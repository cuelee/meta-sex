Figure 5: Comparison of the four approaches (RE, CV, GWAMA, SST) for the
16 significant loci (threshold : 5.0 × 10−8) from the Northern Finland
Birth Cohort data (CRP : C-reactive protein). If there were more than
one significant locus in the same linkage disequilibrium block, we
choose the most significant one. (A) Relative −log10P improvement of
three methods (RE, GWAMA, SST) compared with the CV method, namely,
[−log10P of RE/GWAMA/SST] − [−log10P of CV]. The horizontal line
represents the −log10P of the CV method. The rsids of 16 significant
SNPs as well as their CV p values are shown at the bottom. (B) The ratio
of phenotype variance between males and females after regressing out the
SNP effect for 16 significant SNPs. (C) The ratio of the effect size
between males and females for 16 significant SNPs.
