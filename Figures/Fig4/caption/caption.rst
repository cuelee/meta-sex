Figure 4: Statistical power comparison between CV, SST, RE and GWAMA
approaches while varying the effect sizes of males and females. For the
particular male and female effect size pair, the simulated phenotype was
generated assuming a ratio of 1.2 between sex-specific error variances
(chosen based on NFBC data, male variance = 1.2 Ã— female variance). This
figure shows the 50% power lines for the four different approaches.
Because power increases as effect size increases, the area outside of
the 50% power line (area containing the point where male effect size=1
and female effect size=1) shows the area which the method achieves more
than 50% power. The diagonal line shows the points where the effect
sizes in males and females are equal. The 50% power line is skewed due
to the unequal error variance between male and female studies.
