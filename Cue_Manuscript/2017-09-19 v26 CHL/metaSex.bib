	N2 = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Genome-wide association studies are an effective means of identifying genetic variants that are associated with diseases. Although many associated loci have been identified, those loci account for only a small fraction of the genetic contribution to the disease. The remaining contribution may be accounted by loci with very small effect sizes, so small that tens of thousands of samples are needed to identify them. Since it is costly to conduct a study collecting such a large sample, a practical alternative is to combine multiple independent studies in a single analysis called meta-analysis. However, many factors, such as genetic or environmental factors, can differ between the studies combined in a meta-analysis. These factors can cause the effect size of the causal variant to differ between the studies, a phenomenon called heterogeneity. If heterogeneity exists in the data of a meta-analysis, interpreting the meta-analysis results is an important but difficult task. In this paper, we propose a method that helps such interpretation, in addition to a new association testing procedure that is powerful when heterogeneity exists.</p>},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of longitudinal birth cohorts enable joint investigation of environmental and genetic influences on complex traits. We report GWAS results for nine quantitative metabolic traits (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, body mass index, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) in the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1966 (NFBC1966), drawn from the most genetically isolated Finnish regions. We replicate most previously reported associations for these traits and identify nine new associations, several of which highlight genes with metabolic functions: high-density lipoprotein with NR1H3 (LXRA), low-density lipoprotein with AR and FADS1-FADS2, glucose with MTNR1B, and insulin with PANK1. Two of these new associations emerged after adjustment of results for body mass index. Gene-environment interaction analyses suggested additional associations, which will require validation in larger samples. The currently identified loci, together with quantified environmental exposures, explain little of the trait variation in NFBC1966. The association observed between low-density lipoprotein and an infrequent variant in AR suggests the potential of such a cohort for identifying associations with both common, low-impact and rarer, high-impact quantitative trait loci.},

	Abstract = {Linear mixed models have attracted considerable attention recently as a powerful and effective tool for accounting for population stratification and relatedness in genetic association tests. However, existing methods for exact computation of standard test statistics are computationally impractical for even moderate-sized genome-wide association studies. To address this issue, several approximate methods have been proposed. Here, we present an efficient exact method, which we refer to as genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA), that makes approximations unnecessary in many contexts. This method is approximately n times faster than the widely used exact method known as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), where n is the sample size, making exact genome-wide association analysis computationally practical for large numbers of individuals.},

This information includes knowledge of linkage disequilibrium structure as well as which regions are likely to be involved in disease. In this paper, we present an approach for incorporating this information by revisiting how we perform multiple-hypothesis correction. In a traditional association study, in order to correct for multiple-hypothesis testing, the significance threshold at each marker, t, is set to control the total false-positive rate. In our framework, we vary the threshold at each marker t(i) and use these thresholds to incorporate prior information. We present a numerical procedure for solving for thresholds that maximizes association study power using prior information. We also present the results of benchmark simulation experiments using the HapMap data, which demonstrate a significant increase in association study power under this framework. We provide a Web server for performing association studies using our method and provide thresholds optimized for the Affymetrix 500 k and Illumina HumanHap 550 chips and demonstrate the application of our framework to the analysis of the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data.},

	Abstract = {Age-related hearing loss (AHL) is characterized by a symmetric sensorineural hearing loss primarily in high frequencies and individuals have different levels of susceptibility to AHL. Heritability studies have shown that the sources of this variance are both genetic and environmental, with approximately half of the variance attributable to hereditary factors as reported by Huag and Tang (Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol 267(8):1179-1191, 2010). Only a limited number of large-scale association studies for AHL have been undertaken in humans, to date. An alternate and complementary approach to these human studies is through the use of mouse models. Advantages of mouse models include that the environment can be more carefully controlled, measurements can be replicated in genetically identical animals, and the proportion of the variability explained by genetic variation is increased. Complex traits in mouse strains have been shown to have higher heritability and genetic loci often have stronger effects on the trait compared to humans. Motivated by these advantages, we have performed the first genome-wide association study of its kind in the mouse by combining several data sets in a meta-analysis to identify loci associated with age-related hearing loss. We identified five genome-wide significant loci (<10(-6)). One of these loci confirmed a previously identified locus (ahl8) on distal chromosome 11 and greatly narrowed the candidate region. Specifically, the most significant associated SNP is located 450kb upstream of Fscn2. These data confirm the utility of this approach and provide new high-resolution mapping information about variation within the mouse genome associated with hearing loss.},

	Abstract = {Author Summary
Identifying gene-by-environment interactions is important for understand the architecture of a complex trait. Discovering gene-by-environment interaction requires the observation of the same phenotype in individuals under different environments. Model organism studies are often conducted under different environments. These studies provide an unprecedented opportunity for researchers to identify the gene-by-environment interactions. A difference in the effect size of a genetic variant between two studies conducted in different environments may suggest the presence of a gene-by-environment interaction. In this paper, we propose to employ a random-effect-based meta-analysis approach to identify gene-by-environment interaction, which assumes different or heterogeneous effect sizes between studies. Our approach is motivated by the observation that methods for discovering gene-by-environment interactions are closely related to random effects models for meta-analysis. We show that interactions can be interpreted as heterogeneity and can be detected without utilizing the traditional approaches for discovery of gene-by-environment interactions, which treats the gene-by-environment interactions as covariates in the analysis. We provide a intuitive way to visualize the results of the meta-analysis at a locus which allows us to obtain the biological insights of gene-by-environment interactions. We demonstrate our method by searching for gene-by-environment interactions by combining 17 mouse genetic studies totaling 4,965 distinct animals.},

	Abstract = {A dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) covering the genome and an efficient method to assess SNP genotypes are expected to be available in the near future. An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

We show that 45\% of variance can be explained by considering all SNPs simultaneously. Thus, most of the heritability is not missing but has not previously been detected because the individual effects are too small to pass stringent significance tests.

@article{Sul:PlosGenet:2013,
	Abstract = {Gene expression data, in conjunction with information on genetic variants, have enabled studies to identify expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) or polymorphic locations in the genome that are associated with expression levels. Moreover, recent technological developments and cost decreases have further enabled studies to collect expression data in multiple tissues. One advantage of multiple tissue datasets is that studies can combine results from different tissues to identify eQTLs more accurately than examining each tissue separately. The idea of aggregating results of multiple tissues is closely related to the idea of meta-analysis which aggregates results of multiple genome-wide association studies to improve the power to detect associations. In principle, meta-analysis methods can be used to combine results from multiple tissues. However, eQTLs may have effects in only a single tissue, in all tissues, or in a subset of tissues with possibly different effect sizes. This heterogeneity in terms of effects across multiple tissues presents a key challenge to detect eQTLs. In this paper, we develop a framework that leverages two popular meta-analysis methods that address effect size heterogeneity to detect eQTLs across multiple tissues. We show by using simulations and multiple tissue data from mouse that our approach detects many eQTLs undetected by traditional eQTL methods. Additionally, our method provides an interpretation framework that accurately predicts whether an eQTL has an effect in a particular tissue.},

Seven loci displayed significant sex-difference (FDR<5\%), including four previously established (near GRB14/COBLL1, LYPLAL1/SLC30A10, VEGFA, ADAMTS9) and three novel anthropometric trait loci (near MAP3K1, HSD17B4, PPARG), all of which were genome-wide significant in women (P<5$\times$10(-8)), but not in men. Sex-differences were apparent only for waist phenotypes, not for height, weight, BMI, or hip circumference. Moreover, we found no evidence for genetic effects with opposite directions in men versus women. The PPARG locus is of specific interest due to its role in diabetes genetics and therapy. Our results demonstrate the value of sex-specific GWAS to unravel the sexually dimorphic genetic underpinning of complex traits.},

@article{Mason:AlcoholClinExpRes:2012,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether women derive comparable benefits and have a similar safety and tolerability profile as men from acamprosate, a widely prescribed drug for the maintenance of abstinence in alcohol dependence. The objective of this study was to assess sex-specific differences in the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of acamprosate in the treatment of women and men with alcohol dependence.

METHODS: A sex-specific meta-analysis was conducted based on individual patient data (IPD). Data were obtained from double-blind, randomized controlled trials with quantitative drinking measures in patients with alcohol dependence receiving oral acamprosate or placebo. Sources included PubMed, PsychInfo, and Cochrane electronic databases; reference lists from retrieved articles and presentations at professional meetings; and direct access to authors and companies who provided IPD.

RESULTS: Individual records were obtained from 1,317 women and 4,794 men who participated in 22 eligible studies conducted in 18 countries. IPD meta-analyses found a significant beneficial effect of acamprosate relative to placebo across all 4 efficacy end points: an incremental gain of 10.4\% (95\% CI 7.1 to 13.7, p < 0.001) in percentage of abstinent days, an incremental gain of 11.0\% (7.4 to 14.6, p < 0.001) in percentage of no heavy drinking days, an odds ratio of 1.9 (1.6 to 2.2, p < 0.001) for rate of complete abstinence, and an odds ratio of 1.9 (1.6 to 2.3, p < 0.001) for rate of no heavy drinking, over the study duration. Acamprosate was also associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion (p = 0.004) and medication compliance (p < 0.001) than placebo. Men and women did not differ on any measure of acamprosate efficacy, safety, or tolerability.

CONCLUSIONS: This sex-specific IPD meta-analysis provides evidence that acamprosate has a significant effect compared with placebo in improving rates of abstinence and no heavy drinking in both women and men with alcohol dependence. Further, acamprosate was associated with significantly higher rates of treatment completion and medication compliance than placebo among both women and men and had a comparable safety and tolerability profile.},

@article{Porcu:PlosGenet:2013,
	Abstract = {Thyroid hormone is essential for normal metabolism and development, and overt abnormalities in thyroid function lead to common endocrine disorders affecting approximately 10\% of individuals over their life span. In addition, even mild alterations in thyroid function are associated with weight changes, atrial fibrillation, osteoporosis, and psychiatric disorders. To identify novel variants underlying thyroid function, we performed a large meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies for serum levels of the highly heritable thyroid function markers TSH and FT4, in up to 26,420 and 17,520 euthyroid subjects, respectively. Here we report 26 independent associations, including several novel loci for TSH (PDE10A, VEGFA, IGFBP5, NFIA, SOX9, PRDM11, FGF7, INSR, ABO, MIR1179, NRG1, MBIP, ITPK1, SASH1, GLIS3) and FT4 (LHX3, FOXE1, AADAT, NETO1/FBXO15, LPCAT2/CAPNS2). Notably, only limited overlap was detected between TSH and FT4 associated signals, in spite of the feedback regulation of their circulating levels by the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Five of the reported loci (PDE8B, PDE10A, MAF/LOC440389, NETO1/FBXO15, and LPCAT2/CAPNS2) show strong gender-specific differences, which offer clues for the known sexual dimorphism in thyroid function and related pathologies. Importantly, the TSH-associated loci contribute not only to variation within the normal range, but also to TSH values outside the reference range, suggesting that they may be involved in thyroid dysfunction. Overall, our findings explain, respectively, 5.64\% and 2.30\% of total TSH and FT4 trait variance, and they improve the current knowledge of the regulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis function and the consequences of genetic variation for hypo- or hyperthyroidism.},

	Abstract = {Body fat distribution, particularly centralized obesity, is associated with metabolic risk above and beyond total adiposity. We performed genome-wide association of abdominal adipose depots quantified using computed tomography (CT) to uncover novel loci for body fat distribution among participants of European ancestry. Subcutaneous and visceral fat were quantified in 5,560 women and 4,997 men from 4 population-based studies. Genome-wide genotyping was performed using standard arrays and imputed to ~2.5 million Hapmap SNPs. Each study performed a genome-wide association analysis of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), VAT adjusted for body mass index, and VAT/SAT ratio (a metric of the propensity to store fat viscerally as compared to subcutaneously) in the overall sample and in women and men separately. A weighted z-score meta-analysis was conducted. For the VAT/SAT ratio, our most significant p-value was rs11118316 at LYPLAL1 gene (p = 3.1 $\times$ 10E-09), previously identified in association with waist-hip ratio. For SAT, the most significant SNP was in the FTO gene (p = 5.9 $\times$ 10E-08). Given the known gender differences in body fat distribution, we performed sex-specific analyses. Our most significant finding was for VAT in women, rs1659258 near THNSL2 (p = 1.6 $\times$ 10-08), but not men (p = 0.75). Validation of this SNP in the GIANT consortium data demonstrated a similar sex-specific pattern, with observed significance in women (p = 0.006) but not men (p = 0.24) for BMI and waist circumference (p = 0.04 [women], p = 0.49 [men]). Finally, we interrogated our data for the 14 recently published loci for body fat distribution (measured by waist-hip ratio adjusted for BMI); associations were observed at 7 of these loci. In contrast, we observed associations at only 7/32 loci previously identified in association with BMI; the majority of overlap was observed with SAT. Genome-wide association for visceral and subcutaneous fat revealed a SNP for VAT in women. More refined phenotypes for body composition and fat distribution can detect new loci not previously uncovered in large-scale GWAS of anthropometric traits.},

@article{Magi:GenetEpidemiol:2010,
	Abstract = {Despite the success of genome-wide association studies, much of the genetic contribution to complex human traits is still unexplained. One potential source of genetic variation that may contribute to this "missing heritability" is that which differs in magnitude and/or direction between males and females, which could result from sexual dimorphism in gene expression. Such sex-differentiated effects are common in model organisms, and are becoming increasingly evident in human complex traits through large-scale male- and female-specific meta-analyses. In this article, we review the methodology for meta-analysis of sex-specific genome-wide association studies, and propose a sex-differentiated test of association with quantitative or dichotomous traits, which allows for heterogeneity of allelic effects between males and females. We perform detailed simulations to compare the power of the proposed sex-differentiated meta-analysis with the more traditional "sex-combined" approach, which is ambivalent to gender. The results of this study highlight only a small loss in power for the sex-differentiated meta-analysis when the allelic effects of the causal variant are the same in males and females. However, over a range of models of heterogeneity in allelic effects between genders, our sex-differentiated meta-analysis strategy offers substantial gains in power, and thus has the potential to discover novel loci contributing effects to complex human traits with existing genome-wide association data.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statins in decreasing cardiovascular events in women and men.

BACKGROUND: Published data reviews have suggested that statins might not be as effective in women as in men in decreasing cardiovascular events.

METHODS: Published data searches and contacts with investigators identified 18 randomized clinical trials of statins with sex-specific outcomes (N = 141,235, 40,275 women, 21,468 cardiovascular events). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) for cardiovascular events were calculated for women and men separately with random effects meta-analyses.

RESULTS: The cardiovascular event rate was lower among those randomized to statin intervention than in those randomized to control (low-dose statin in 4 studies, placebo in 11 studies, usual care in 3 studies) and similar in women and men (OR: 0.81, 95\% CI: 0.75 to 0.89; p < 0.0001, and OR: 0.77, 95\% CI: 0.71 to 0.83, p < 0.0001, respectively). The benefit of statins was statistically significant in both sexes, regardless of the type of control, baseline risk, or type of endpoint and in both primary and secondary prevention. All-cause mortality was also lower with statin therapy both in women and men without significant interaction by sex (p for interaction = 0.4457).

CONCLUSIONS: Statin therapy is associated with significant decreases in cardiovascular events and in all-cause mortality in women and men. Statin therapy should be used in appropriate patients without regard to sex.},

@article{Boraska:HumMolGenet:2012,
	Abstract = {The male-to-female sex ratio at birth is constant across world populations with an average of 1.06 (106 male to 100 female live births) for populations of European descent. The sex ratio is considered to be affected by numerous biological and environmental factors and to have a heritable component. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of common allele modest effects at autosomal and chromosome X variants that could explain the observed sex ratio at birth. We conducted a large-scale genome-wide association scan (GWAS) meta-analysis across 51 studies, comprising overall 114 863 individuals (61 094 women and 53 769 men) of European ancestry and 2 623 828 common (minor allele frequency >0.05) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Allele frequencies were compared between men and women for directly-typed and imputed variants within each study. Forward-time simulations for unlinked, neutral, autosomal, common loci were performed under the demographic model for European populations with a fixed sex ratio and a random mating scheme to assess the probability of detecting significant allele frequency differences. We do not detect any genome-wide significant (P < 5 $\times$ 10(-8)) common SNP differences between men and women in this well-powered meta-analysis. The simulated data provided results entirely consistent with these findings. This large-scale investigation across ~115 000 individuals shows no detectable contribution from common genetic variants to the observed skew in the sex ratio. The absence of sex-specific differences is useful in guiding genetic association study design, for example when using mixed controls for sex-biased traits.},

@article{Chen:ObesRev:2013,
	Abstract = {The aims of our meta-analysis were (i) to quantify the predictability of childhood overweight and obesity on the risk of incident asthma; and (ii) to evaluate the gender difference on this relationship. The selection criteria included prospective cohort paediatric studies which use age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) as a measure of childhood overweight and the primary outcome of incident asthma. A total of 1,027 studies were initially identified through online database searches, and finally 6 studies met the inclusion criteria. The combined result of reported relative risk from the 6 included studies revealed that overweight children conferred increased risks of incident asthma as compared with non-overweight children (relative risk, 1.19; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.03-1.37). The relationship was further elevated for obesity vs. non-obesity (relative risk, 2.02; 95\% CI, 1.16-3.50). A dose-responsiveness of elevated BMI on asthma incidence was observed (P for trend, 0.004). Obese boys had a significantly larger effect than obese girls (relative risk, boys: 2.47; 95\% CI, 1.57-3.87; girls: 1.25; 95\% CI, 0.51-3.03), with significant dose-dependent effect. Proposed mechanisms of gender difference could be through pulmonary mechanics, sleep disordered breathing and leptin. Further research might be needed to better understand the exact mechanism of gender difference on the obesity-asthma relationship.},

@article{Peters:Stroke:2013,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Conflicting results have been reported on whether the association between increments in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cardiovascular disease differs between men and women. We performed a systematic review with meta-analysis to compare reliably sex-specific associations between SBP and cardiovascular risk.

METHODS: PubMed MEDLINE was systematically searched for prospective population-based cohort studies published between January 1, 1966, and March 31, 2012. Studies were selected if they presented sex-specific estimates, with associated variability, of the relative risk for either ischemic heart disease or stroke according to SBP. The data were pooled using random effects models with inverse variance weighting, and estimates of the ratio of the relative risks per 10 mm Hg increment in SBP, comparing women with men, were derived.

RESULTS: Data from 124 prospective cohort studies, including information on 1197 472 individuals (44\% women) and 26 176 stroke and 24 434 ischemic heart disease events, were included. Overall, there was no evidence to suggest a sex difference in the relationship between SBP and either the risk of stroke (pooled ratio of relative risks, 0.98 [95\% confidence interval, 0.96; 1.01]; P=0.13) or ischemic heart disease (pooled ratio of relative risks, 1.00 [95\% confidence interval, 0.97; 1.04]; P=0.85).

CONCLUSIONS: Elevated levels of SBP are a major risk factor for stroke and ischemic heart diseases in both women and men. This study unequivocally demonstrates the broadly similar impact of SBP increments on cardiovascular outcomes in both sexes.},

@article{Kubo:Gut:2013,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Barrett's oesophagus is a precursor lesion of oesophageal adenocarcinoma, a cancer that, in the USA, has increased in incidence over 600\% during the past 40 years. Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma are much more common among men than among women; this finding is unexplained and most earlier studies lacked sufficient numbers of women to evaluate sex-specific risk factors. We leveraged the power of an international consortium to assess sex-specific relationships between body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference and Barrett's oesophagus. DESIGN: Four case-control studies provided a total of 1102 cases (316 women, 786 men) and 1400 population controls (436 women, 964 men) for analysis. Study-specific estimates, generated using individual participant data, were combined using random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: Waist circumference was significantly associated with Barrett's oesophagus, even after adjustment for BMI; persons in the highest versus the lowest quartiles of waist circumference had approximately 125\% and 275\% increases in the odds of Barrett's oesophagus among men and women, respectively (OR 2.24, 95\% CI 1.08 to 4.65, I(2)=57; OR 3.75, 95\% CI 1.47 to 9.56, I(2)=0). In contrast, there was no evidence of a significant association between BMI and the risk of Barrett's oesophagus, with or without adjustment for waist circumference. CONCLUSIONS: Waist circumference, independent of BMI, was found to be a risk factor for Barrett's oesophagus among both men and women. Future studies examining the biological mechanisms of this association will extend our knowledge regarding the pathogenesis of Barrett's oesophagus.},

@article{Nakata:Circulation:2008,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The roles of nitric oxide (NO) in the cardiovascular system have been investigated extensively in pharmacological studies with NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors and in studies with NOS isoform-deficient mice. However, because of the nonspecificity of the NOS inhibitors and the compensatory interactions among NOS isoforms (nNOS, iNOS, and eNOS), the ultimate roles of endogenous NO derived from the entire NOS system are still poorly understood. In this study, we examined this point in mice deficient in all 3 NOS isoforms (triply n/i/eNOS(-/-) mice) that we have recently developed.

METHODS AND RESULTS: The triply n/i/eNOS(-/-) mice, but not singly eNOS(-/-) mice, exhibited markedly reduced survival, possibly due to spontaneous myocardial infarction accompanied by severe coronary arteriosclerotic lesions. Furthermore, the triply n/i/eNOS(-/-) mice manifested phenotypes that resembled metabolic syndrome in humans, including visceral obesity, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and impaired glucose tolerance. Importantly, activation of the renin-angiotensin system was noted in the triply n/i/eNOS(-/-) mice, and long-term oral treatment with an angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker significantly suppressed coronary arteriosclerotic lesion formation and the occurrence of spontaneous myocardial infarction and improved the prognosis of those mice, along with ameliorating the metabolic abnormalities.

CONCLUSIONS: These results provide the first direct evidence that genetic disruption of the whole NOS system causes spontaneous myocardial infarction associated with multiple cardiovascular risk factors of metabolic origin in mice in vivo through the angiotensin II type 1 receptor pathway, demonstrating the critical role of the endogenous NOS system in maintaining cardiovascular and metabolic homeostasis.},

@article{Li:JBiolChem:2009,
	Abstract = {In mammals, a family of five acyl-CoA synthetases (ACSLs), each the product of a separate gene, activates long chain fatty acids to form acyl-CoAs. Because the ACSL isoforms have overlapping preferences for fatty acid chain length and saturation and are expressed in many of the same tissues, the individual function of each isoform has remained uncertain. Thus, we constructed a mouse model with a liver-specific knock-out of ACSL1, a major ACSL isoform in liver. Eliminating ACSL1 in liver resulted in a 50\% decrease in total hepatic ACSL activity and a 25-35\% decrease in long chain acyl-CoA content. Although the content of triacylglycerol was unchanged in Acsl1(L)(-/-) liver after mice were fed either low or high fat diets, in isolated primary hepatocytes the absence of ACSL1 diminished the incorporation of [(14)C]oleate into triacylglycerol. Further, small but consistent increases were observed in the percentage of 16:0 in phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine and of 18:1 in phosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine, whereas concomitant decreases were seen in 18:0 in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and lysophosphatidylcholine. In addition, decreases in long chain acylcarnitine content and diminished production of acid-soluble metabolites from [(14)C]oleate suggested that hepatic ACSL1 is important for mitochondrial beta-oxidation of long chain fatty acids. Because the Acsl1(L)(-/-) mice were not protected from developing either high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis or insulin resistance, our study suggests that lowering the content of hepatic acyl-CoA without a concomitant decrease in triacylglycerol and other lipid intermediates is insufficient to protect against hepatic insulin resistance.},

@article{Leshan:NatMed:2012,
	Abstract = {Few effective measures exist to combat the worldwide obesity epidemic(1), and the identification of potential therapeutic targets requires a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that control energy balance. Leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone that signals the long-term status of bodily energy stores, acts through multiple types of leptin receptor long isoform (LepRb)-expressing neurons (called here LepRb neurons) in the brain to control feeding, energy expenditure and endocrine function(2-4). The modest contributions to energy balance that are attributable to leptin action in many LepRb populations(5-9) suggest that other previously unidentified hypothalamic LepRb neurons have key roles in energy balance. Here we examine the role of LepRb in neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS1)-expressing LebRb (LepRb(NOS1)) neurons that comprise approximately 20\% of the total hypothalamic LepRb neurons. Nos1(cre)-mediated genetic ablation of LepRb (Lepr(Nos1KO)) in mice produces hyperphagic obesity, decreased energy expenditure and hyperglycemia approaching that seen in whole-body LepRb-null mice. In contrast, the endocrine functions in Lepr(Nos1KO) mice are only modestly affected by the genetic ablation of LepRb in these neurons. Thus, hypothalamic LepRb(NOS1) neurons are a key site of action of the leptin-mediated control of systemic energy balance.},

	Abstract = {RNA editing that converts adenosine to inosine replaces the gene-encoded Ile, Asn, and Ile (INI) of serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] receptor 2C (5-HT(2C)R) with Val, Gly, and Val (VGV). Up to 24 different 5-HT(2C)R isoforms are detected in different brain regions (Burns et al., 1997; Fitzgerald et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2000). To elucidate the physiological significance of 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing, we derived mutant mouse lines harboring a knock-in INI or VGV allele, resulting in sole expression of one of two extremely different editing isoforms 5-HT(2C)R-INI (editing blocked) or -VGV (fully edited). Although INI mice grew normally, VGV mice had a severely reduced fat mass, despite compensatory hyperphagia, as a result of constitutive activation of the sympathetic nervous system and increased energy expenditure. Furthermore, serotonergic neurotransmission was oversensitized in VGV mice, most likely because of the increased cell surface expression of VGV receptors. Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) regulates energy homeostasis (Balthasar et al., 2005; Heisler et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2008), and Mc4r(-/-) mice are obese because of hyperphagia and reduced energy expenditure (Huszar et al., 1997). However, the elevated energy expenditure of VGV mice could not be rescued in the Mc4r(-/-) background, indicating the presence of a distinct signaling pathway mediated via 5-HT(2C)R-VGV that dominates the MC4R-dependent pathway in control of energy expenditure. Our results highlight the importance of regulated 5-HT(2C)R mRNA editing, because dysregulation could result in the pathological consequences such as growth retardation seen in VGV mice.},

	Abstract = {A Wnt coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) plays an essential role in bone accrual and eye development. Here, we show that LRP5 is also required for normal cholesterol and glucose metabolism. The production of mice lacking LRP5 revealed that LRP5 deficiency led to increased plasma cholesterol levels in mice fed a high-fat diet, because of the decreased hepatic clearance of chylomicron remnants. In addition, when fed a normal diet, LRP5-deficient mice showed a markedly impaired glucose tolerance. The LRP5-deficient islets had a marked reduction in the levels of intracellular ATP and Ca(2+) in response to glucose, and thereby glucose-induced insulin secretion was decreased. The intracellular inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) production in response to glucose was also reduced in LRP5-- islets. Real-time PCR analysis revealed a marked reduction of various transcripts for genes involved in glucose sensing in LRP5-- islets. Furthermore, exposure of LRP5++ islets to Wnt-3a and Wnt-5a stimulates glucose-induced insulin secretion and this stimulation was blocked by the addition of a soluble form of Wnt receptor, secreted Frizzled-related protein-1. In contrast, LRP5-deficient islets lacked the Wnt-3a-stimulated insulin secretion. These data suggest that WntLRP5 signaling contributes to the glucose-induced insulin secretion in the islets.},

@article{Liu:Hepatology:2007,
	Abstract = {UNLABELLED: Glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT) affects genetic stability by regulating DNA methylation and interacting with environmental carcinogens. To establish a Gnmt knockout mouse model, 2 lambda phage clones containing a mouse Gnmt genome were isolated. At 11 weeks of age, the Gnmt-/- mice had hepatomegaly, hypermethioninemia, and significantly higher levels of both serum alanine aminotransferase and hepatic S-adenosylmethionine. Such phenotypes mimic patients with congenital GNMT deficiencies. A real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of 10 genes in the one-carbon metabolism pathway revealed that 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase (Ahcy), and formiminotransferase cyclodeaminase (Ftcd) were significantly down-regulated in Gnmt-/- mice. This report demonstrates that GNMT regulates the expression of both Ftcd and Ahcy genes. Results from pathological examinations indicated that 57.1\% (8 of 14) of the Gnmt-/- mice had glycogen storage disease (GSD) in their livers. Focal necrosis was observed in male Gnmt-/- livers, whereas degenerative changes were found in the intermediate zones of female Gnmt-/- livers. In addition, hypoglycemia, increased serum cholesterol, and significantly lower numbers of white blood cells, neutrophils, and monocytes were observed in the Gnmt-/- mice. A real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis of genes involved in the gluconeogenesis pathways revealed that the following genes were significantly down-regulated in Gnmt-/- mice: fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and glucose-6-phosphate transporter.

CONCLUSION: Because Gnmt-/- mice phenotypes mimic those of patients with GNMT deficiencies and share several characteristics with GSD Ib patients, we suggest that they are useful for studies of the pathogenesis of congenital GNMT deficiencies and the role of GNMT in GSD and liver tumorigenesis.},

@article{Sainsbury:MolCellBiol:2003,
	Abstract = {Neuropeptide Y regulates numerous physiological processes via at least five different Y receptors, but the specific roles of each receptor are still unclear. We previously demonstrated that Y2 receptor knockout results in a lean phenotype, increased cancellous bone volume, and an increase in plasma pancreatic polypeptide (PP), a ligand for Y4 receptors. PP-overexpressing mice are also known to have a lean phenotype. Deletion of the Y4 receptor also produced a lean phenotype and increased plasma PP levels. We therefore hypothesized that part of the Y2 phenotype results from increased PP action on Y4 receptors and tested this in PP transgenic Y4(-/-) and Y2(-/-) Y4(-/-) double knockout mice. Bone mass was not altered in Y4 knockout mice. Surprisingly, despite significant hyperphagia, Y2(-/-) Y4(-/-) mice retained a markedly lean phenotype, with reduced body weight, white adipose tissue mass, leptinemia, and insulinemia. Furthermore, bone volume was also increased threefold in Y2(-/-) Y4(-/-) mice, and this was associated with enhanced osteoblastic activity. These changes were more pronounced than those observed in Y2(-/-) mice, suggesting synergy between Y2 and Y4 receptor pathways. The lack of bone changes in PP transgenic mice suggests that PP alone is not responsible for the bone mass increases but might play a major role in the lean phenotype. However, a synergistic interaction between Y2 and Y4 pathways seems to regulate bone volume and adiposity and could have important implications for possible interventions in obesity and for anabolic treatment of osteoporotic bone loss.},

	Abstract = {Peroxisomal genetic disorders, such as Zellweger syndrome, are characterized by defects in one or more enzymes involved in the peroxisomal beta-oxidation of very long chain fatty acids and are associated with defective peroxisomal biogenesis. The biologic role of peroxisomal beta-oxidation system, which consists of three enzymes: fatty acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), enoyl-CoA hydratase/3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HD), and thiolase, has been examined in mice by disrupting ACOX gene, which encodes the first and rate-limiting enzyme of this system. Homozygous (ACOX -/-) mice lacked the expression of ACOX protein and accumulate very long chain fatty acids in blood. However, these homozygous mice are viable, but growth-retarded and infertile. During the first 3-4 months of age, the livers of ACOX -/- mice reveal severe microvesicular fatty metamorphosis of hepatocytes. In such steatotic cells, peroxisome assembly is markedly defective; as a result, they contain few or no peroxisomes. Few hepatocytes in 1-3-month-old ACOX -/- mice contain numerous peroxisomes, and these peroxisome-rich hepatocytes show no fatty change. At this stage, the basal mRNA levels of HD, thiolase, and other peroxisome proliferator-induced target genes were elevated in ACOX -/- mouse liver, but these mice, when treated with a peroxisome proliferator, showed no increases in the number of hepatic peroxisomes and in the mRNAs levels of these target genes. Between 4 and 5 months of age, severe steatosis resulted in scattered cell death, steatohepatitis, formation of lipogranulomas, and focal hepatocellular regeneration. In 6-7-month-old animals, the newly emerging hepatocytes, which progressively replaced steatotic cells, revealed spontaneous peroxisome proliferation. These livers showed marked increases in the mRNA levels of the remaining two genes of the beta-oxidation system, suggesting that ACOX gene disruption leads to increased endogenous ligand-mediated transcription levels. These observations demonstrate links among peroxisomal beta-oxidation, development of severe microvesicular fatty liver, peroxisome assembly, cell death, and cell proliferation in liver.},

	Abstract = {The phospholipid scramblases (PLSCR1 to PLSCR4) are a structurally and functionally unique class of proteins, which are products of a tetrad of genes conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to humans. The best characterized member of this family, PLSCR1, is implicated in the remodeling of the transbilayer distribution of plasma membrane phospholipids but is also required for normal signaling through select growth factor receptors. Mice with targeted deletion of PLSCR1 display perinatal granulocytopenia due to defective response of hematopoietic precursors to granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stem cell factor. To gain insight into the biologic function of another member of the PLSCR family, we investigated mice with targeted deletion of PLSCR3, a protein that like PLSCR1 is expressed in many blood cells but which, by contrast to PLSCR1, is also highly expressed in fat and muscle. PLSCR3(-/-) mice at 2 months of age displayed aberrant accumulation of abdominal fat when maintained on standard rodent chow, which was accompanied by insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia. Primary adipocytes and cultured bone-marrow-derived macrophages from PLSCR3(-/-) mice were engorged with neutral lipid, and adipocytes displayed defective responses to exogenous insulin. Plasma of PLSCR3(-/-) mice was elevated in non-high-density lipoproteins, cholesterol, triglycerides, nonesterified fatty acids, and leptin, whereas adiponectin was low. These data suggest that the expression of PLSCR3 may be required for normal adipocyte and/or macrophage maturation or function and raise the possibility that deletions or mutations affecting the PLSCR3(-/-) gene locus may contribute to the risk for lipid-related disorders in humans.},

@article{Kim:JLipidRes:2007,
	Abstract = {Bile acid concentrations are controlled by a feedback regulatory pathway whereby activation of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) represses transcription of both the CYP7A1 gene, encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic bile acid synthesis pathway, and the CYP8B1 gene, required for synthesis of cholic acid. The tissue-specific roles of FXR were examined using liver- and intestine-specific FXR-null models. FXR deficiency in either liver (Fxr DeltaL) or intestine (Fxr DeltaIE) increased bile acid pool size. Treatment with the FXR-selective agonist GW4064 significantly repressed CYP7A1 in Fxr DeltaL mice but not Fxr DeltaIE mice, demonstrating that activation of FXR in intestine but not liver is required for short-term repression of CYP7A1 in liver. This intestinal-specific effect of FXR is likely mediated through induction of the hormone FGF15, which suppresses CYP7A1. In comparison to CYP7A1, FXR-mediated repression of CYP8B1 was more dependent on the presence of FXR in liver and less dependent on its presence in intestine. Consistent with these findings, recombinant FGF15 repressed CYP7A1 mRNA levels without affecting CYP8B1 expression. These data provide evidence that FXR-mediated repression of bile acid synthesis requires the complementary actions of FXR in both liver and intestine and reveal mechanistic differences in feedback repression of CYP7A1 and CYP8B1.},

	Abstract = {The early colocalization of T cells and the potent immunostimulatory cytokine IFN-gamma to atherosclerotic lesions suggest that the immune system contributes to atherogenesis. Since mice with a targeted disruption of the apoE gene (apoE 0 mice) develop profound atherosclerosis, we examined the role of IFN-gamma in this process. First, the presence of CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells, which secrete lesional IFN-gamma, was documented in apoE 0 atheromata. Then, the apoE 0 mice were crossed with IFN-gamma receptor (IFNgammaR) 0 mice to generate apoE 0/IFNgammaR 0 mice. Compared to the apoE 0 mice, the compound knock-out mice exhibited a substantial reduction in atherosclerotic lesion size, a 60\% reduction in lesion lipid accumulation, a decrease in lesion cellularity, but a marked increase in lesion collagen content. Evaluation of the plasma lipoproteins showed that the compound knockout mice had a marked increase in potentially atheroprotective phospholipid/apoA-IV rich particles as well. This correlated with an induction of hepatic apoA-IV transcripts. These observations suggest that IFN-gamma promotes and modifies atherosclerosis through both local effects in the arterial wall as well as a systemic effect on plasma lipoproteins. Therefore, therapeutic inhibition of IFN-gamma signaling may lead to the formation of more lipid-poor and stable atheromata.},

Although different PI3K catalytic subunits are known to play distinct roles, the specific in vivo function of p110beta (the product of the PIK3CB gene) is not clear. Here, we show that mouse mutants expressing a catalytically inactive PIK3CB(K805R) mutant survived to adulthood but showed growth retardation and developed mild insulin resistance with age. Pharmacological and genetic analyses of p110beta function revealed that p110beta catalytic activity is required for PI3K signaling downstream of heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding protein (G protein)-coupled receptors as well as to sustain long-term insulin signaling. In addition, PIK3CB(K805R) mice were protected in a model of ERBB2-driven tumor development.

In the absence of cre recombinase the modified catalytic subunit allele is functionally silent, but after recombination the mutant allele is expressed, resulting in enhanced PKA effects at basal cAMP levels. Mice expressing the modified protein in hepatocytes using albumin-cre transgenics show defects in glucose homeostasis, glycogen storage, fructose 2,6-bisphosphate levels, and induction of glucokinase mRNA during feeding. Similar to animals lacking glucokinase in the liver (Postic et al.: J Biol Chem 274:305-315, 1999), these mice also have defects in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, a hallmark of Type II diabetes. The widespread expression of PKA and the involvement of this kinase in a myriad of signaling pathways suggest that these animals will provide critical tools for the study of PKA function in vivo.},

	Abstract = {Mice with five different mutations conferring an obese or diabetic phenotype were evaluated for fatty streak lesions after consuming an atherogenic diet containing 15\% fat and 1.25\% cholesterol (wt/wt) for 14 weeks. The five mutations, fat, obese, tubby, diabetes, and lethal yellow, are maintained as congenic strains with C57BL/6J (B6) or C57BL/KsJ (BKs) as genetic backgrounds. None of the mutants exhibited accelerated fatty streak lesion formation; the mutant fat had aortic lesions comparable in size to those of its control strain, and the mutants obese, diabetes, tubby, and lethal yellow had significantly reduced lesion area in comparison to controls. Although B6 and BKs are closely related strains, we observed that the BKs strain was more prone to early-stage atherogenesis. Fatty streak lesion area was twice as large in BKs mice than those found in B6 mice; likewise, in comparison, the mutants obese and diabetes had larger lesions if they were carried as congenic strains in the BKs rather than the B6 genetic background. Plasma triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and combined low-density and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C and VLDL) levels were also measured in the mice. Lipid profiles differed among the mutant mice, but in general, elevations in plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-C were observed. Whereas the hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia are consistent with an atherogenic lipid profile, HDL-C levels, which are normally decreased in individuals with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, were increased in the mouse mutants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

	Abstract = {Uromodulin-associated kidney disease is a heritable renal disease in humans caused by mutations in the uromodulin (UMOD) gene. The pathogenesis of the disease is mostly unknown. In this study, we describe a novel chemically induced mutant mouse line termed Umod(A227T) exhibiting impaired renal function. The A227T amino acid exchange may impair uromodulin trafficking, leading to dysfunction of thick ascending limb cells of Henle's loop of the kidney. As a consequence, homozygous mutant mice display azotemia, impaired urine concentration ability, reduced fractional excretion of uric acid, and a selective defect in concentrating urea. Osteopenia in mutant mice is presumably a result of chronic hypercalciuria. In addition, body composition, lipid, and energy metabolism are indirectly affected in heterozygous and homozygous mutant Umod(A227T) mice, manifesting in reduced body weight, fat mass, and metabolic rate as well as reduced blood cholesterol, triglycerides, and nonesterified fatty acids. In conclusion, Umod(A227T) might act as a gain-of-toxic-function mutation. Therefore, the Umod(A227T) mouse line provides novel insights into consequences of disturbed uromodulin excretion regarding renal dysfunction as well as bone, energy, and lipid metabolism.},

	Abstract = {The broad aim of biomedical science in the postgenomic era is to link genomic and phenotype information to allow deeper understanding of the processes leading from genomic changes to altered phenotype and disease. The EuroPhenome project (http://www.EuroPhenome.org) is a comprehensive resource for raw and annotated high-throughput phenotyping data arising from projects such as EUMODIC. EUMODIC is gathering data from the EMPReSSslim pipeline (http://www.empress.har.mrc.ac.uk/) which is performed on inbred mouse strains and knock-out lines arising from the EUCOMM project. The EuroPhenome interface allows the user to access the data via the phenotype or genotype. It also allows the user to access the data in a variety of ways, including graphical display, statistical analysis and access to the raw data via web services. The raw phenotyping data captured in EuroPhenome is annotated by an annotation pipeline which automatically identifies statistically different mutants from the appropriate baseline and assigns ontology terms for that specific test. Mutant phenotypes can be quickly identified using two EuroPhenome tools: PhenoMap, a graphical representation of statistically relevant phenotypes, and mining for a mutant using ontology terms. To assist with data definition and cross-database comparisons, phenotype data is annotated using combinations of terms from biological ontologies.},

	Abstract = {Hepatic clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins depends on heparan sulfate and low density lipoprotein receptors expressed on the basal membrane of hepatocytes. Binding and uptake of the lipoproteins by way of heparan sulfate depends on the degree of sulfation of the chains based on accumulation of plasma triglycerides and delayed clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in mice bearing a hepatocyte-specific alteration of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase 1 (Ndst1) (MacArthur, J. M., Bishop, J. R., Stanford, K. I., Wang, L., Bensadoun, A., Witztum, J. L., and Esko, J. D. (2007) J. Clin. Invest. 117, 153-164). Inactivation of Ndst1 led to decreased overall sulfation of heparan sulfate due to coupling of uronyl 2-O-sulfation and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfation to initial N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residues. To determine whether lipoprotein clearance depends on 2-O-and 6-O-sulfation, we evaluated plasma triglyceride levels in mice containing loxP-flanked conditional alleles of uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (Hs2st(f/f)) and glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferase-1 (Hs6st1(f/f)) and the bacterial Cre recombinase expressed in hepatocytes from the rat albumin (Alb) promoter. We show that Hs2st(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice accumulated plasma triglycerides and exhibited delayed clearance of intestinally derived chylomicrons and injected human very low density lipoproteins to the same extent as observed in Ndst1(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice. In contrast, Hs6st1(f/f)AlbCre(+) mice did not exhibit any changes in plasma triglycerides. Chemically modified heparins lacking N-sulfate and 2-O-sulfate groups did not block very low density lipoprotein binding and uptake in isolated hepatocytes, whereas heparin lacking 6-O-sulfate groups was as active as unaltered heparin. Our findings show that plasma lipoprotein clearance depends on specific subclasses of sulfate groups and not on overall charge of the chains.},

@article{Qiao:AmJPathol:1997,
	Abstract = {Previous in vitro and in vivo studies have suggested that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) plays a role in atherogenesis. To examine this hypothesis, we have studied atherogenesis in osteopetrotic (op/op) mice, which lack M-CSF due to a structural gene mutation. Atherogenesis was induced either by feeding the mice a high fat, high cholesterol diet or by crossing op mice with apolipoprotein E (apo E) knockout mice to generate mice lacking both M-CSF and apo E. In both the dietary and apo E knockout models, M-CSF deficiency resulted in significantly reduced atherogenesis. For example, in the apo E knockout model, homozygosity for the op mutation totally abolished aortic atherogenesis in male mice and reduced the size of the lesions approximately 97\% in female mice. Mice heterozygous for the op mutation also exhibited a significant decrease in lesion size. Among apo E knockout mice, the frequency of atherosclerosis in aortic arch was 0/6 (op/op), 1/15 (op/+), and 12/16 (+/+). The effect of the M-CSF on atherosclerosis did not appear to be mediated by changes in plasma lipoproteins, as the op mice exhibited higher levels of atherogenic lipoprotein particles. The effects of the op mutation on atherogenesis may have resulted from decreased circulating monocytes, reduced tissue macrophages, or diminished arterial M-CSF.},

	Abstract = {Obesity, the metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are major global health problems. Insulin resistance is frequently present in these disorders, but the causes and effects of such resistance are unknown. Here, we generated mice with muscle-specific knockout of the major murine atypical PKC (aPKC), PKC-lambda, a postulated mediator for insulin-stimulated glucose transport. Glucose transport and translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane were diminished in muscles of both homozygous and heterozygous PKC-lambda knockout mice and were accompanied by systemic insulin resistance; impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes; islet beta cell hyperplasia; abdominal adiposity; hepatosteatosis; elevated serum triglycerides, FFAs, and LDL-cholesterol; and diminished HDL-cholesterol. In contrast to the defective activation of muscle aPKC, insulin signaling and actions were intact in muscle, liver, and adipocytes. These findings demonstrate the importance of aPKC in insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscles of intact mice and show that insulin resistance and resultant hyperinsulinemia owing to a specific defect in muscle aPKC is sufficient to induce abdominal obesity and other lipid abnormalities of the metabolic syndrome and T2DM. These findings are particularly relevant because humans who have obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, and T2DM reportedly have defective activation and/or diminished levels of muscle aPKC.},

	Abstract = {Mutations in the human Notch ligand jagged 1 (JAG1) result in a multi-system disorder called Alagille syndrome (AGS). AGS is chiefly characterized by a paucity of intrahepatic bile ducts (IHBD), but also includes cardiac, ocular, skeletal, craniofacial and renal defects. The disease penetration and severity of the affected organs can vary significantly and the molecular basis for this broad spectrum of pathology is unclear. Here, we report that Jag1 inactivation in the portal vein mesenchyme (PVM), but not in the endothelium of mice, leads to the hepatic defects associated with AGS. Loss of Jag1 expression in SM22$\alpha$-positive cells of the PVM leads to defective bile duct development beyond the initial formation of the ductal plate. Cytokeratin 19-positive cells are detected surrounding the portal vein, yet they are unable to form biliary tubes, revealing an instructive role of the vasculature in liver development. These findings uncover the cellular basis for the defining feature of AGS, identify mesenchymal Jag1-dependent and -independent stages of duct development, and provide mechanistic information for the role of Jag1 in IHBD formation.},

	Abstract = {Blind sterile 2 (bs2) is a spontaneous autosomal recessive mouse mutation exhibiting cataracts and male sterility. Detailed clinical and histological evaluation revealed that bs2 mice have cataracts resulting from severely disrupted lens fiber cells. Analysis of bs2 testes revealed the absence of mature sperm and the presence of large multinucleate cells within the lumens of seminiferous tubules. Linkage analysis mapped the bs2 locus to mouse chromosome 2, approximately 45cM distal from the centromere. Fine mapping established a 3.1Mb bs2 critical region containing 19 candidate genes. Sequence analysis of alkylglycerone-phosphate synthase (Agps), a gene within the bs2 critical region, revealed a G to A substitution at the +5 position of intron 14. This mutation results in two abundantly expressed aberrantly spliced Agps transcripts: Agps(exon14) lacking exon 14 or Agps(exon13-14) lacking both exons 13 and 14 as well as full-length Agps transcript. Agps is a peroxisomal enzyme which catalyzes the formation of the ether bond during the synthesis of ether lipids. Both aberrantly spliced Agps(exon14) and Agps(exon13-14) transcripts led to a frame shift, premature stop and putative proteins lacking the enzymatic FAD domain. We present evidence that bs2 mice have significantly decreased levels of ether lipids. Human mutations in Agps result in rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 3 (RCDP3), a disease for which bs2 is the only genetic model. Thus, bs2 is a hypomorphic mutation in Agps, and represents a useful model for investigation of the tissue specificity of ether lipid requirements which will be particularly valuable for elucidating the mechanism of disease phenotypes resulting from ether lipid depletion.},

	Abstract = {The major high density lipoprotein (HDL) apolipoprotein, apoA-I, was knocked out by gene targeting in ES cells to provide a model for the study of HDL metabolism and its relationship to plasma and tissue cholesterol metabolism. HDL and non-HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) were reduced in apoA-I-deficient mice. Feeding a high fat-high cholesterol diet raised HDL-C minimally in apoA-I knockout compared to the large increase seen in control mice, suggesting an interaction between diet and apoA-I genotype. In apoA-I-deficient mice, HDL was normal in size but altered in composition. Compared to control mice there was more triglyceride and free cholesterol and less cholesteryl ester (CE), suggesting that apoA-I-deficient HDL is a poor substrate for hepatic lipase and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). The metabolic basis of the low HDL-C levels in the apoA-I knockout mice was decreased flux into the HDL CE pool. The absolute delivery of HDL CE to both peripheral tissues and liver was also decreased. As tissue cholesterol levels and synthesis were unchanged, the decreased flux of cholesterol into the HDL CE pool was most likely due to decreased efflux of cholesterol from the peripheral tissues and decreased functional LCAT activity. The low HDL-C state in the apoA-I-deficient mouse was associated with an absolute decrease in unidirectional transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to the liver but this did not lead to cholesterol accumulation in the periphery or a cholesterol deficit in the liver; nor was there altered peripheral tissue HMG-CoA reductase activity. The only sign of decreased cholesterol flux to the liver was a 2.3-fold decrease in liver cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mRNA, suggesting decreased bile acid synthesis. In the apoA-I knockout mouse model it appears that low HDL levels create a new steady state in which decreased cholesterol is delivered to both peripheral tissues and the liver.},

	Abstract = {Exercise has beneficial effects on human health, including protection against metabolic disorders such as diabetes. However, the cellular mechanisms underlying these effects are incompletely understood. The lysosomal degradation pathway, autophagy, is an intracellular recycling system that functions during basal conditions in organelle and protein quality control. During stress, increased levels of autophagy permit cells to adapt to changing nutritional and energy demands through protein catabolism. Moreover, in animal models, autophagy protects against diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, infections, inflammatory diseases, ageing and insulin resistance. Here we show that acute exercise induces autophagy in skeletal and cardiac muscle of fed mice. To investigate the role of exercise-mediated autophagy in vivo, we generated mutant mice that show normal levels of basal autophagy but are deficient in stimulus (exercise- or starvation)-induced autophagy. These mice (termed BCL2 AAA mice) contain knock-in mutations in BCL2 phosphorylation sites (Thr69Ala, Ser70Ala and Ser84Ala) that prevent stimulus-induced disruption of the BCL2-beclin-1 complex and autophagy activation. BCL2 AAA mice show decreased endurance and altered glucose metabolism during acute exercise, as well as impaired chronic exercise-mediated protection against high-fat-diet-induced glucose intolerance. Thus, exercise induces autophagy, BCL2 is a crucial regulator of exercise- (and starvation)-induced autophagy in vivo, and autophagy induction may contribute to the beneficial metabolic effects of exercise.},

Here, we provide genetic evidence that type III phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinase (PIPKIII), which produces PtdIns(3,5)P(2), is essential for the functions of polarized epithelial cells. PIPKIII-null mouse embryos die by embryonic day 8.5 because of a failure of the visceral endoderm to supply the epiblast with maternal nutrients. Similarly, although intestine-specific PIPKIII-deficient mice are born, they fail to thrive and eventually die of malnutrition. At the mechanistic level, we show that PIPKIII regulates the trafficking of proteins to a cell's apical membrane domain. Importantly, mice with intestine-specific deletion of PIPKIII exhibit diarrhea and bloody stool, and their gut epithelial layers show inflammation and fibrosis, making our mutants an improved model for inflammatory bowel diseases. In summary, our data demonstrate that PIPKIII is required for the structural and functional integrity of two different types of polarized epithelial cells and suggest that PtdIns(3,5)P(2) metabolism is an unexpected and critical link between membrane trafficking in intestinal epithelial cells and the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.},

Our approach includes inbred parental strains as well as recombinant inbred strains in order to capture loci with effect sizes typical of complex traits in mice (in the range of 5\% of total trait variance). Over the last few years, we have typed the hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) strains for a variety of clinical traits as well as intermediate phenotypes and have shown that the HMDP has sufficient power to map genes for highly complex traits with resolution that is in most cases less than a megabase. In this essay, we review our experience with the HMDP, describe various ongoing projects, and discuss how the HMDP may fit into the larger picture of common diseases and different approaches.},

We developed a conservative and robust bootstrap analysis to map 843 QTLs with an average 95\% confidence interval of 2.8 Mb. The QTLs contribute to variation in 97 traits, including models of human disease (asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity and anxiety) as well as immunological, biochemical and hematological phenotypes.

Here we describe an experiment that uses partially inbred CC lines to evaluate the genetic properties and utility of this emerging resource. Genome-wide analysis of the incipient strains reveals high genetic diversity, balanced allele frequencies, and dense, evenly distributed recombination sites-all ideal qualities for a systems genetics resource. We map discrete, complex, and biomolecular traits and contrast two quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping approaches. Analysis based on inferred haplotypes improves power, reduces false discovery, and provides information to identify and prioritize candidate genes that is unique to multifounder crosses like the CC. The number of expression QTLs discovered here exceeds all previous efforts at eQTL mapping in mice, and we map local eQTL at 1-Mb resolution. We demonstrate that the genetic diversity of the CC, which derives from random mixing of eight founder strains, results in high phenotypic diversity and enhances our ability to map causative loci underlying complex disease-related traits.},

@article{Xiao:AdvDrugDelivRev:2010,
	Abstract = {Nuclear receptor crosstalk represents an important mechanism to expand the functions of individual receptors. The liver X receptors (LXR, NR1H2/3), both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ isoforms, are nuclear receptors that can be activated by the endogenous oxysterols and other synthetic agonists. LXRs function as cholesterol sensors, which protect mammals from cholesterol overload. LXRs have been shown to regulate the expression of a battery of metabolic genes, especially those involved in lipid metabolism. LXRs have recently been suggested to play a novel role in the regulation of drug metabolism. The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR, NR1I3) is a xenobiotic receptor that regulates the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters. Disruption of CAR alters sensitivity to toxins, increasing or decreasing it depending on the compounds. More recently, additional roles for CAR have been discovered. These include the involvement of CAR in lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, CAR forms an intricate regulatory network with other members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, foremost the LXRs, in exerting its effect on lipid metabolism. Retinoid-related orphan receptors (RORs, NR1F1/2/3) have three isoforms, $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Recent reports have shown that loss of ROR$\alpha$ and/or ROR$\gamma$ can positively or negatively influence the expression of multiple drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters in the liver. The effects of RORs on expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes were reasoned to be, at least in part, due to the crosstalk with LXR. This review focuses on the CAR-LXR and ROR-LXR crosstalk, and the implications of this crosstalk in drug metabolism and lipid metabolism.},

	Abstract = {Genetic variations in blood cell parameters can impact clinical traits. We report here the mapping of blood cell traits in a panel of 100 inbred strains of mice of the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) using genome-wide association (GWA). We replicated a locus previously identified in using linkage analysis in several genetic crosses for mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and a number of other red blood cell traits on distal chromosome 7. Our peak for SNP association to MCV occurred in a linkage disequilibrium (LD) block spanning from 109.38 to 111.75Mb that includes Hbb-b1, the likely causal gene. Altogether, we identified five loci controlling red blood cell traits (on chromosomes 1, 7, 11, 12, and 16), and four of these correspond to loci for red blood cell traits reported in a recent human GWA study. For white blood cells, including granulocytes, monocytes, and lymphocytes, a total of six significant loci were identified on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 11, 12, and 15. An average of ten candidate genes were found at each locus and those were prioritized by examining functional variants in the HMDP such as missense and expression variants. These results provide intermediate phenotypes and candidate loci for genetic studies of atherosclerosis and cancer as well as inflammatory and immune disorders in mice.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies using commercially available outbred mice can detect genes involved in phenotypes of biomedical interest. Useful populations need high-frequency alleles to ensure high power to detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs), low linkage disequilibrium between markers to obtain accurate mapping resolution, and an absence of population structure to prevent false positive associations. We surveyed 66 colonies for inbreeding, genetic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium, and we demonstrate that some have haplotype blocks of less than 100 Kb, enabling gene-level mapping resolution. The same alleles contribute to variation in different colonies, so that when mapping progress stalls in one, another can be used in its stead. Colonies are genetically diverse: 45\% of the total genetic variation is attributable to differences between colonies. However, quantitative differences in allele frequencies, rather than the existence of private alleles, are responsible for these population differences. The colonies derive from a limited pool of ancestral haplotypes resembling those found in inbred strains: over 95\% of sequence variants segregating in outbred populations are found in inbred strains. Consequently it is possible to impute the sequence of any mouse from a dense SNP map combined with inbred strain sequence data, which opens up the possibility of cataloguing and testing all variants for association, a situation that has so far eluded studies in completely outbred populations. We demonstrate the colonies' potential by identifying a deletion in the promoter of H2-Ea as the molecular change that strongly contributes to setting the ratio of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes.},

	Abstract = {To investigate the regulation of expression of the human cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene, transgenic mice were prepared using a CETP minigene linked to the natural flanking sequences of the human CETP gene. By using a transgene containing 3.2 kb of upstream and 2.0 kb of downstream flanking sequence, five different lines of transgenic mice were generated. The abundance of CETP mRNA in various tissues was determined on standard laboratory diet or high fat, high cholesterol diets. In three lines of transgenic mice the tissues expressing the human CETP mRNA were similar to those in humans (liver, spleen, small intestine, kidney, and adipose tissue); in two lines expression was more restricted. There was a marked (4-10-fold) induction of liver CETP mRNA in response to a high fat, high cholesterol diet. The increase in hepatic CETP mRNA was accompanied by a fivefold increase in transcription rate of the CETP transgene, and a 2.5-fold increase in plasma CETP mass and activity. In contrast, CETP transgenic mice, in which the CETP minigene was linked to a metallothionein promoter rather than to its own flanking sequences, showed no change in liver CETP mRNA in response to a high cholesterol diet. Thus (a) the CETP minigene or natural flanking sequences contain elements directing authentic tissue-specific expression; (b) a high cholesterol diet induces CETP transgene transcription, causing increased hepatic CETP mRNA and plasma CETP; (c) this cholesterol response requires DNA sequences contained in the natural flanking regions of the human CETP gene.},

	Abstract = {Apolipoprotein (apo) E3-Leiden, described in a large Dutch family, is associated with a dominantly inherited form of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. To study the effect of the APOE*3-Leiden mutation in vivo, transgenic mice were generated using a genomic 27-kilobase DNA construct isolated from the APOE*3-Leiden proband. This construct carried the APOE gene, the APOC1 gene, and all known regulatory elements including an element that mediates liver expression. Three strains were generated that showed human APOE and APOC1 expression. All strains had significantly elevated levels of total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides on a regular diet. When mice of one strain were fed a semisynthetic cholesterol-rich diet, total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels increased dramatically. This increase was observed mainly in the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)- and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-sized fractions. In cholesterol-fed mice, the apoE3-Leiden protein became equally distributed between the VLDL/LDL and HDL-sized fractions, while in mice kept on a regular diet, apoE3-Leiden protein was mainly associated with HDL-sized fractions. The presence of hyperlipoproteinemia in the APOE*3-Leiden-expressing transgenic mice supports our finding that the apoE3-Leiden variant behaves like a dominant trait in the expression of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. ApoE3-Leiden transgenic mice may serve as a model to elucidate additional factors involved in the metabolism of apoE containing remnant lipoproteins in general and the etiology of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia in particular.},

We provide a valid and efficient approach to such meta-analysis, allowing for overlapping study subjects. The available data may contain individual participant records or only meta-analytic summary results. Simulation studies demonstrate that failure to account for overlapping subjects can greatly inflate type I error when combining results from multiple studies of the same disease and can drastically reduce power when comparing results across different disorders. In addition, the proposed approach can be substantially more powerful than the simple approach of splitting the overlapping subjects among studies, especially for comparing results across different disorders. The advantages of the new approach are illustrated with empirical data from two sets of genome-wide association studies.},

	Abstract = {A pentapeptide released from procolipase, enterostatin, selectively attenuates dietary fat intake when administered peripherally or centrally. Enterostatin may act through the afferent vagus nerve and in the hypothalamus and amygdala, primarily in the central nucleus of the amygdala. To investigate the physiological role of endogenous enterostatin, we created an enterostatin-deficient, colipase-sufficient (Ent(-/-)) mouse. Ent(-/-) mice are viable, normally active, and fertile. They exhibit normal growth on low-fat and high-fat diets. Furthermore, Ent(-/-) mice develop diet-induced obesity, as do Ent(+/+) mice, and have normal responses to a two-macronutrient choice diet and to a switch from a high-fat to a low-fat diet. Levels of total serum (P = 0.004) and non-HDL (P <or= 0.001) cholesterol were higher and levels of HDL cholesterol (P = 0.01) were lower in Ent(-/-) than in wild-type mice. To determine whether enterostatin contributed to the decreased survival or whether colipase deficiency was the sole contributor, we administered enterostatin to procolipase-deficient (Clps(-/-)) mouse pups. Enterostatin significantly improved survival (P <or= 0.001). Our results demonstrate that enterostatin is not critically required to regulate food intake or growth, suggesting that other pathways may compensate for the loss of enterostatin. Enterostatin has developmental effects on survival of newborns and alters cholesterol metabolism.},

To bring these advantages to the wider research community, large-scale mouse knockout programmes are producing a permanent resource of targeted mutations in all protein-coding genes. Here we report the establishment of a high-throughput gene-targeting pipeline for the generation of reporter-tagged, conditional alleles. Computational allele design, 96-well modular vector construction and high-efficiency gene-targeting strategies have been combined to mutate genes on an unprecedented scale. So far, more than 12,000 vectors and 9,000 conditional targeted alleles have been produced in highly germline-competent C57BL/6N embryonic stem cells. High-throughput genome engineering highlighted by this study is broadly applicable to rat and human stem cells and provides a foundation for future genome-wide efforts aimed at deciphering the function of all genes encoded by the mammalian genome.},

	Abstract = {Lipin-1 is the major phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) in the heart and a transcriptional coactivator that regulates fatty acid (FA) oxidation in the liver. As the control of FA metabolism is essential for maintaining cardiac function, we investigated whether lipin-1 deficiency affects cardiac metabolism and performance. Cardiac PAP activity in lipin-1 deficient [fatty liver dystrophy (fld)] mice was decreased by >80\% compared with controls. Surprisingly, oleate oxidation and incorporation in triacylglycerol (TG), as well as glucose oxidation, were not significantly different in perfused working fld hearts. Despite this, [$^{3}$H]oleate accumulation in phosphatidate and phosphatidylinositol was increased in fld hearts, reflecting the decreased PAP activity. Phosphatidate accumulation was linked to increased cardiac mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Transthoracic echocardiography showed decreased cardiac function in fld mice; however, cardiac dysfunction was not observed in ex vivo perfused working fld hearts. This showed that changes in systemic factors due to the global absence of lipin-1 could contribute to the decreased cardiac function in vivo. Collectively, this study shows that fld hearts exhibit unchanged oleate esterification, as well as oleate and glucose oxidation, despite the absence of lipin-1. However, lipin-1 deficiency increases the accumulation of newly synthesized phosphatidate and induces aberrant cell signaling.},

Through positional cloning, we have isolated the gene responsible and characterized two independent mutant alleles, fld and fld(2J). The gene (Lpin1) encodes a novel nuclear protein which we have named lipin. Consistent with the observed reduction of adipose tissue mass in fld and fld(2J)mice, wild-type Lpin1 mRNA is expressed at high levels in adipose tissue and is induced during differentiation of 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes. Our results indicate that lipin is required for normal adipose tissue development, and provide a candidate gene for human lipodystrophy.

	Abstract = {Lipodystrophy and obesity represent extreme and opposite ends of the adiposity spectrum and have typically been attributed to alterations in the expression or function of distinct sets of genes. We previously demonstrated that lipin deficiency impairs adipocyte differentiation and causes lipodystrophy in the mouse. Using two different tissue-specific lipin transgenic mouse strains, we now demonstrate that enhanced lipin expression in either adipose tissue or skeletal muscle promotes obesity. This occurs through diverse mechanisms in the two tissues, with lipin levels in adipose tissue influencing the fat storage capacity of the adipocyte, and lipin levels in skeletal muscle acting as a determinant of whole-body energy expenditure and fat utilization. Thus, variations in lipin levels alone are sufficient to induce extreme states of adiposity and may represent a mechanism by which adipose tissue and skeletal muscle modulate fat mass and energy balance.},

Atherosclerosis-susceptible C57BL/6J mice possess plasma HDL levels 2-fold lower than atherosclerosis-resistant FVB/NJ mice. Polymorphisms have been previously identified between the two mouse strains in the major HDL apolipoproteins, ApoA-I and ApoA-II, which may affect their function on HDL. To begin to understand the HDL differences, we here report on a detailed comparison of the lipid-associated functions of the two mouse ApoA-I proteins. We demonstrate that these polymorphisms significantly alter the protein self-association properties, the ability of the proteins to clear lipid micelles from solution, and their binding affinity for mature mouse HDL. The changes in lipid binding do not appear to alter the ability of the protein to promote cholesterol efflux from cells or the formation of nascent HDL from primary hepatocytes. These apolipoprotein polymorphisms do not change the rate at which HDL protein or cholesterol are catabolized in vivo. Although the presence of the polymorphisms in ApoA-I alters important factors in HDL formation, the basis for the differences in the HDL plasma levels observed in the various mouse strains is more complex and requires additional investigation.},

Human genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified a number of loci contributing to obesity; however, a major limitation of these studies is the inability to assess environmental interactions common to obesity. Using a systems genetics approach, we measured obesity traits, global gene expression, and gut microbiota composition in response to a high-fat/high-sucrose (HF/HS) diet of more than 100 inbred strains of mice. Here we show that HF/HS feeding promotes robust, strain-specific changes in obesity that are not accounted for by food intake and provide evidence for a genetically determined set point for obesity. GWAS analysis identified 11 genome-wide significant loci associated with obesity traits, several of which overlap with loci identified in human studies. We also show strong relationships between genotype and gut microbiota plasticity during HF/HS feeding and identify gut microbial phylotypes associated with obesity.},

	Abstract = {Systems genetics relies on common genetic variants to elucidate biologic networks contributing to complex disease-related phenotypes. Mice are ideal model organisms for such approaches, but linkage analysis has been only modestly successful due to low mapping resolution. Association analysis in mice has the potential of much better resolution, but it is confounded by population structure and inadequate power to map traits that explain less than 10\% of the variance, typical of mouse quantitative trait loci (QTL). We report a novel strategy for association mapping that combines classic inbred strains for mapping resolution and recombinant inbred strains for mapping power. Using a mixed model algorithm to correct for population structure, we validate the approach by mapping over 2500 cis-expression QTL with a resolution an order of magnitude narrower than traditional QTL analysis. We also report the fine mapping of metabolic traits such as plasma lipids. This resource, termed the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, makes possible the integration of multiple data sets and should prove useful for systems-based approaches to complex traits and studies of gene-by-environment interactions.},

We incorporated sex and sex-by-genotype interactions into our model selection procedure to identify 10 quantitative trait loci for lesion size, revealing a level of complexity greater than previously thought. Of the known risk factors for atherosclerosis, plasma triglyceride levels and plasma glucose to insulin ratios were particularly strongly, but negatively, associated with lesion size. We performed expression array analysis for 23,574 transcripts of the livers and adipose tissues of all 334 F2 mice and identified more than 10,000 expression quantitative trait loci that either mapped to the gene encoding the transcript, implying cis regulation, or to a separate locus, implying trans-regulation. The gene expression data allowed us to identify candidate genes that mapped to the atherosclerosis quantitative trait loci and for which the expression was regulated in cis. Genes highly correlated with lesions were enriched in certain known pathways involved in lesion development, including cholesterol metabolism, mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and inflammation. Thus, global gene expression in peripheral tissues can reflect the systemic perturbations that contribute to atherosclerosis.},

	Abstract = {Inbred strains of mice are strikingly different in susceptibility to obesity-driven diabetes. For instance, deficiency in leptin receptor (db/db) leads to hyperphagia and obesity in both C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mice, but only on the DBA/2 background do the mice develop beta-cell loss leading to severe diabetes, while C57BL/6 mice are relatively resistant. To further investigate the genetic factors predisposing to diabetes, we have studied leptin receptor-deficient offspring of an F2 cross between C57BL/6J (db/+) males and DBA/2J females. The results show that the genetics of diabetes susceptibility are enormously complex and a number of quantitative trait loci (QTL) contributing to diabetes-related traits were identified, notably on chromosomes 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 19. The Chr. 4 locus is likely due to a disruption of the Zfp69 gene in C57BL/6J mice. To identify candidate genes and to model coexpression networks, we performed global expression array analysis in livers of the F2 mice. Expression QTL (eQTL) were identified and used to prioritize candidate genes at clinical trait QTL. In several cases, clusters of eQTLs colocalized with clinical trait QTLs, suggesting a common genetic basis. We constructed coexpression networks for both 5 and 12 wk old mice and identified several modules significantly associated with clinical traits. One module in 12 wk old mice was associated with several measures of hepatic fat content as well as with other lipid- and diabetes-related traits. These results add to the understanding of the complex genetic interactions contributing to obesity-induced diabetes.},

@article{Devlin:TheorPopulBiol:2001,
	Abstract = {During the past decade, mutations affecting liability to human disease have been discovered at a phenomenal rate, and that rate is increasing. For the most part, however, those diseases have a relatively simple genetic basis. For diseases with a complex genetic and environmental basis, new approaches are needed to pave the way for more rapid discovery of genes affecting liability. One such approach exploits large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population heterogeneity can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We describe a method called genomic control (GC), which obviates many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. Two such approaches are now available. The GC approach exploits the fact that population substructure generate "overdispersion" of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The other approach, called Structured Association (SA), assumes that the sampled population, while heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, SA probabilistically assigns sampled individuals to these latent subpopulations. We review in detail the overdispersion GC. In addition to outlining the published ideas on this method, we describe several extensions: quantitative trait studies and case-control studies with haplotypes and multiallelic markers. For each study design our goal is to achieve control similar to that obtained for a family-based study, but with the convenience found in a population-based design.},

	Abstract = {Asbestos exposure is a known risk factor for lung cancer. Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified some novel loci for lung cancer risk, few addressed genome-wide gene-environment interactions. To determine gene-asbestos interactions in lung cancer risk, we conducted genome-wide gene-environment interaction analyses at levels of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), genes and pathways, using our published Texas lung cancer GWAS dataset. This dataset included 317 498 SNPs from 1154 lung cancer cases and 1137 cancer-free controls. The initial SNP-level P-values for interactions between genetic variants and self-reported asbestos exposure were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models with adjustment for age, sex, smoking status and pack-years. The P-value for the most significant SNP rs13383928 was 2.17$\times$10(-6), which did not reach the genome-wide statistical significance. Using a versatile gene-based test approach, we found that the top significant gene was C7orf54, located on 7q32.1 (P = 8.90$\times$10(-5)). Interestingly, most of the other significant genes were located on 11q13. When we used an improved gene-set-enrichment analysis approach, we found that the Fas signaling pathway and the antigen processing and presentation pathway were most significant (nominal P < 0.001; false discovery rate < 0.05) among 250 pathways containing 17 572 genes. We believe that our analysis is a pilot study that first describes the gene-asbestos interaction in lung cancer risk at levels of SNPs, genes and pathways. Our findings suggest that immune function regulation-related pathways may be mechanistically involved in asbestos-associated lung cancer risk.},

	Abstract = {Little is known about gene-environment interactions in Parkinson disease (PD). We examined potential interactions of smoking and caffeine intake with 10 genome-wide association studies single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) at or near the SNCA, MAPT, LRRK2, and HLA loci among 584 PD patients and 1571 controls. The main effects of these SNPs and environmental exposures were consistent with previous reports. Family history of PD was associated with PD risk (odds ratio = 2.71, 95\% confidence interval, 1.97-3.74), which was little affected by further adjustment for these SNPs and environmental exposures. Overall, we did not find significant interactions of either smoking or caffeine intake with these SNPs. However, with a combined smoking and caffeine intake exposure, we found a significant interaction with rs2896905 at SLC2A13, near LRRK2 (p uncorrected = 0.0008). Each A allele was associated with a 35\% higher PD risk among never smokers with low caffeine intake, but with a 32\% lower risk among smokers with high caffeine intake. This study provides preliminary evidence of a potential gene-environment interaction for PD, which should be investigated in future studies.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: We aimed at extending the Natural and Orthogonal Interaction (NOIA) framework, developed for modeling gene-gene interactions in the analysis of quantitative traits, to allow for reduced genetic models, dichotomous traits, and gene-environment interactions. We evaluate the performance of the NOIA statistical models using simulated data and lung cancer data.

METHODS: The NOIA statistical models are developed for additive, dominant, and recessive genetic models as well as for a binary environmental exposure. Using the Kronecker product rule, a NOIA statistical model is built to model gene-environment interactions. By treating the genotypic values as the logarithm of odds, the NOIA statistical models are extended to the analysis of case-control data.

RESULTS: Our simulations showed that power for testing associations while allowing for interaction using the NOIA statistical model is much higher than using functional models for most of the scenarios we simulated. When applied to lung cancer data, much smaller p values were obtained using the NOIA statistical model for either the main effects or the SNP-smoking interactions for some of the SNPs tested.

CONCLUSION: The NOIA statistical models are usually more powerful than the functional models in detecting main effects and interaction effects for both quantitative traits and binary traits.},

We identified nine new ESCC susceptibility loci, of which seven, at chromosomes 4q23, 16q12.1, 17q21, 22q12, 3q27, 17p13 and 18p11, had a significant marginal effect (P=1.78$\times$10(-39) to P=2.49$\times$10(-11)) and two of which, at 2q22 and 13q33, had a significant association only in the gene-alcohol drinking interaction (gene-environment interaction P (PG$\times$E)=4.39$\times$10(-11) and PG$\times$E=4.80$\times$10(-8), respectively). Variants at the 4q23 locus, which includes the ADH cluster, each had a significant interaction with alcohol drinking in their association with ESCC risk (PG$\times$E=2.54$\times$10(-7) to PG$\times$E=3.23$\times$10(-2)). We confirmed the known association of the ALDH2 locus on 12q24 to ESCC, and a joint analysis showed that drinkers with both of the ADH1B and ALDH2 risk alleles had a fourfold increased risk for ESCC compared to drinkers without these risk alleles. Our results underscore the direct genetic contribution to ESCC risk, as well as the genetic contribution to ESCC through interaction with alcohol consumption.},

@article{Patel:HumGenet:2013,
	Abstract = {Diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) result from environmental and genetic factors, and risk varies considerably in the population. T2D-related genetic loci discovered to date explain only a small portion of the T2D heritability. Some heritability may be due to gene-environment interactions. However, documenting these interactions has been difficult due to low availability of concurrent genetic and environmental measures, selection bias, and challenges in controlling for multiple hypothesis testing. Through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), investigators have identified over 90single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated to T2D. Using a method analogous to GWAS [environment-wide association study (EWAS)], we found five environmental factors associated with the disease. By focusing on risk factors that emerge from GWAS and EWAS, it is possible to overcome difficulties in uncovering gene-environment interactions. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), we screened 18 SNPs and 5 serum-based environmental factors for interaction in association to T2D. We controlled for multiple hypotheses using false discovery rate (FDR) and Bonferroni correction and found four interactions with FDR <20\%. The interaction between rs13266634 (SLC30A8) and trans-$\beta$-carotene withstood Bonferroni correction (corrected p=0.006, FDR <1.5\%). The per-risk-allele effect sizes in subjects with low levels of trans-$\beta$-carotene were 40\% greater than the marginal effect size [odds ratio (OR) 1.8, 95\% CI 1.3-2.6]. We hypothesize that impaired function driven by rs13266634 increases T2D risk when combined with serum levels of nutrients. Unbiased consideration of environmental and genetic factors may help identify larger and more relevant effect sizes for disease associations.},

	Abstract = {Bilirubin is an effective antioxidant and is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple loci affecting serum total bilirubin levels. However, most of the studies were conducted in European populations and little attention has been devoted either to genetic variants associated with direct and indirect bilirubin levels or to the gene-environment interactions on bilirubin levels. In this study, a two-stage GWAS was performed to identify genetic variants associated with all types of bilirubin levels in 10,282 Han Chinese individuals. Gene-environment interactions were further examined. Briefly, two previously reported loci, UGT1A1 on 2q37 (rs6742078 and rs4148323, combined P = 1.44 $\times$ 10(-89) and P = 5.05 $\times$ 10(-69) , respectively) and SLCO1B3 on 12p12 (rs2417940, combined P = 6.93 $\times$ 10(-19) ) were successfully replicated. The two loci explained 9.2\% and 0.9\% of the total variations of total bilirubin levels, respectively. Ethnic genetic differences were observed between Chinese and European populations. More importantly, a significant interaction was found between rs2417940 in SLCO1B3 gene and smoking on total bilirubin levels (P = 1.99 $\times$ 10(-3) ). Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2417940 had stronger effects on total bilirubin levels in nonsmokers than in smokers, suggesting that the effects of SLCO1B3 genotype on bilirubin levels were partly dependent on smoking status. Consistent associations and interactions were observed for serum direct and indirect bilirubin levels.},

Here we used a systems genetics strategy to examine the role of common genetic variation in macrophage responses to inflammatory stimuli. We examined genome-wide transcript levels in macrophages from 92 strains of the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. We exposed macrophages to control media, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), or oxidized phospholipids. We performed association mapping under each condition and identified several thousand expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), gene-by-environment interactions, and eQTL "hot spots" that specifically control LPS responses. We used siRNA knockdown of candidate genes to validate an eQTL hot spot in chromosome 8 and identified the gene 2310061C15Rik as a regulator of inflammatory responses in macrophages. We have created a public database where the data presented here can be used as a resource for understanding many common inflammatory traits that are modeled in the mouse and for the dissection of regulatory relationships between genes.},

	Abstract = {Low birth weight (LBW) and hypoxia are among the environmental factors most reliably associated with schizophrenia; however, the nature of this relationship is unclear and both gene-environment interaction and gene-environment covariation models have been proposed as explanations. High-risk (HR) designs that explore whether obstetric complications differentially predict outcomes in offspring at low risk (LR) vs HR for schizophrenia, while accounting for differences in rates of maternal risk factors, may shed light on this question. This study used prospectively obtained data to examine relationships between LBW and hypoxia on school outcome at age 15-16 years in a Finnish sample of 1070 offspring at LR for schizophrenia and 373 offspring at HR for schizophrenia, based on parental psychiatric history. Controlling for offspring sex, maternal smoking, social support, parity, age, and number of prenatal care visits, HR offspring performed worse than LR offspring across academic, nonacademic, and physical education domains. LBW predicted poorer academic and physical education performance in HR offspring, but not in LR offspring, and this association was similar for offspring of fathers vs mothers with schizophrenia. Hypoxia predicted poorer physical education score across risk groups. Rates of LBW and hypoxia were similar for LR and HR offspring and for offspring of fathers vs mothers with schizophrenia. Results support the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility to schizophrenia confers augmented vulnerability of the developing brain to the effects of obstetric complications, possibly via epigenetic mechanisms.},

This suggests that at the molecular level there is interaction between the gene product(s) and/or the by-products of the environmental insult, and from a statistical viewpoint this implies a deviation from the expected multiplicative effect on risk. In other words genetic risk is modifiable in an environment-specific manner. This Review focuses on recently reported effects of smoking and alcohol (environmental factors) on the impact of variation in the genes for apoE (APOE) and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADHC1) on heart disease risk. Considering gene-environment interaction has the potential not only for improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease, but also in the development and targeting of specific therapies.},

	Abstract = {The effects of genetic variants on phenotypic traits often depend on environmental and physiological conditions, but such gene-environment interactions are poorly understood. Recently developed approaches that treat transcript abundances of thousands of genes as quantitative traits offer the opportunity to broadly characterize the architecture of gene-environment interactions. We examined the genetic and molecular basis of variation in gene expression between two yeast strains (BY and RM) grown in two different conditions (glucose and ethanol as carbon sources). We observed that most transcripts vary by strain and condition, with 2,996, 3,448, and 2,037 transcripts showing significant strain, condition, and strain-condition interaction effects, respectively. We expression profiled over 100 segregants derived from a cross between BY and RM in both growth conditions, and identified 1,555 linkages for 1,382 transcripts that show significant gene-environment interaction. At the locus level, local linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms in cis-regulatory elements, tend to be more stable across conditions, such that they are more likely to show the same effect or the same direction of effect across conditions. Distant linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms influencing trans-acting factors, are more condition-dependent, and often show effects in different directions in the two conditions. We characterized a locus that influences expression of many growth-related transcripts, and showed that the majority of the variation is explained by polymorphism in the gene IRA2. The RM allele of IRA2 appears to inhibit Ras/PKA signaling more strongly than the BY allele, and has undergone a change in selective pressure. Our results provide a broad overview of the genetic architecture of gene-environment interactions, as well as a detailed molecular example, and lead to key insights into how the effects of different classes of regulatory variants are modulated by the environment. These observations will guide the design of studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.},

	Abstract = {Faced with a global epidemic of type 2 diabetes (T2D), it is critical that researchers improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of T2D and related vascular complications. These findings may ultimately lead to novel treatment options for disease prevention or delaying progression. Two major paradigms jointly underlie the development of T2D and related coronary artery disease, diabetic nephropathy, and diabetic retinopathy. These paradigms include the genetic risk variants and behavioral/environmental factors. This article systematically reviews the literature supporting genetic determinants in the pathogenesis of T2D and diabetic vasculopathy, and the functional implications of these gene variants on the regulation of beta-cell function and glucose homeostasis. We update the discovery of diabetes and diabetic vasculopathy risk variants, and describe the genetic technologies that have uncovered them. Also, genomic linkage between obesity and T2D is discussed. There is a complementary role for behavioral and environmental factors modulating the genetic susceptibility and diabetes risk. Epidemiological and clinical data demonstrating the effects of behavioral and novel environmental exposures on disease expression are reviewed. Finally, a succinct overview of recent landmark clinical trials addressing glycemic control and its impact on rates of vascular complications is presented. It is expected that novel strategies to exploit the gene- and exposure-related underpinnings of T2D will soon result.},

@article{Gerke:PlosGenet:2010,
	Abstract = {Interactions among genes and the environment are a common source of phenotypic variation. To characterize the interplay between genetics and the environment at single nucleotide resolution, we quantified the genetic and environmental interactions of four quantitative trait nucleotides (QTN) that govern yeast sporulation efficiency. We first constructed a panel of strains that together carry all 32 possible combinations of the 4 QTN genotypes in 2 distinct genetic backgrounds. We then measured the sporulation efficiencies of these 32 strains across 8 controlled environments. This dataset shows that variation in sporulation efficiency is shaped largely by genetic and environmental interactions. We find clear examples of QTN:environment, QTN: background, and environment:background interactions. However, we find no QTN:QTN interactions that occur consistently across the entire dataset. Instead, interactions between QTN only occur under specific combinations of environment and genetic background. Thus, what might appear to be a QTN:QTN interaction in one background and environment becomes a more complex QTN:QTN:environment:background interaction when we consider the entire dataset as a whole. As a result, the phenotypic impact of a set of QTN alleles cannot be predicted from genotype alone. Our results instead demonstrate that the effects of QTN and their interactions are inextricably linked both to genetic background and to environmental variation.},

	Abstract = {Meta-analysis is an increasingly popular tool for combining multiple genome-wide association studies in a single analysis to identify associations with small effect sizes. The effect sizes between studies in a meta-analysis may differ and these differences, or heterogeneity, can be caused by many factors. If heterogeneity is observed in the results of a meta-analysis, interpreting the cause of heterogeneity is important because the correct interpretation can lead to a better understanding of the disease and a more effective design of a replication study. However, interpreting heterogeneous results is difficult. The standard approach of examining the association p-values of the studies does not effectively predict if the effect exists in each study. In this paper, we propose a framework facilitating the interpretation of the results of a meta-analysis. Our framework is based on a new statistic representing the posterior probability that the effect exists in each study, which is estimated utilizing cross-study information. Simulations and application to the real data show that our framework can effectively segregate the studies predicted to have an effect, the studies predicted to not have an effect, and the ambiguous studies that are underpowered. In addition to helping interpretation, the new framework also allows us to develop a new association testing procedure taking into account the existence of effect.},

	Abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H) that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

	Abstract = {Meta-analysis is an increasingly popular tool for combining multiple different genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in a single aggregate analysis in order to identify associations with very small effect sizes. Because the data of a meta-analysis can be heterogeneous, referring to the differences in effect sizes between the collected studies, what is often done in the literature is to apply both the fixed-effects model (FE) under an assumption of the same effect size between studies and the random-effects model (RE) under an assumption of varying effect size between studies. However, surprisingly, RE gives less significant p values than FE at variants that actually show varying effect sizes between studies. This is ironic because RE is designed specifically for the case in which there is heterogeneity. As a result, usually, RE does not discover any associations that FE did not discover. In this paper, we show that the underlying reason for this phenomenon is that RE implicitly assumes a markedly conservative null-hypothesis model, and we present a new random-effects model that relaxes the conservative assumption. Unlike the traditional RE, the new method is shown to achieve higher statistical power than FE when there is heterogeneity, indicating that the new method has practical utility for discovering associations in the meta-analysis of GWASs.},

@article{Furlotte:Genetics:2012,
	Abstract = {Genetic studies in mouse models have played an integral role in the discovery of the mechanisms underlying many human diseases. The primary mode of discovery has been the application of linkage analysis to mouse crosses. This approach results in high power to identify regions that affect traits, but in low resolution, making it difficult to identify the precise genomic location harboring the causal variant. Recently, a panel of mice referred to as the hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) has been developed to overcome this problem. However, power in this panel is limited by the availability of inbred strains. Previous studies have suggested combining results across multiple panels as a means to increase power, but the methods employed may not be well suited to structured populations, such as the HMDP. In this article, we introduce a meta-analysis-based method that may be used to combine HMDP studies with F2 cross studies to gain power, while increasing resolution. Due to the drastically different genetic structure of F2s and the HMDP, the best way to combine two studies for a given SNP depends on the strain distribution pattern in each study. We show that combining results, while accounting for these patterns, leads to increased power and resolution. Using our method to map bone mineral density, we find that two previously implicated loci are replicated with increased significance and that the size of the associated is decreased. We also map HDL cholesterol and show a dramatic increase in the significance of a previously identified result.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10.},

Starting from genome-wide genotype data for 1924 diabetic cases and 2938 population controls generated by the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, we set out to detect replicated diabetes association signals through analysis of 3757 additional cases and 5346 controls and by integration of our findings with equivalent data from other international consortia. We detected diabetes susceptibility loci in and around the genes CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and IGF2BP2 and confirmed the recently described associations at HHEX/IDE and SLC30A8. Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of multiple variants of modest effect. The regions identified underscore the importance of pathways influencing pancreatic beta cell development and function in the etiology of type 2 diabetes.},

With collaborators (FUSION and WTCCC/UKT2D), we identified and confirmed three loci associated with T2D-in a noncoding region near CDKN2A and CDKN2B, in an intron of IGF2BP2, and an intron of CDKAL1-and replicated associations near HHEX and in SLC30A8 found by a recent whole-genome association study. We identified and confirmed association of a SNP in an intron of glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) with serum triglycerides.

	Abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BP) is a disabling and often life-threatening disorder that affects approximately 1\% of the population worldwide. To identify genetic variants that increase the risk of BP, we genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 Beadchip 2,076 bipolar cases and 1,676 controls of European ancestry from the National Institute of Mental Health Human Genetics Initiative Repository, and the Prechter Repository and samples collected in London, Toronto, and Dundee. We imputed SNP genotypes and tested for SNP-BP association in each sample and then performed meta-analysis across samples. The strongest association P value for this 2-study meta-analysis was 2.4 x 10(-6). We next imputed SNP genotypes and tested for SNP-BP association based on the publicly available Affymetrix 500K genotype data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium for 1,868 BP cases and a reference set of 12,831 individuals. A 3-study meta-analysis of 3,683 nonoverlapping cases and 14,507 extended controls on >2.3 M genotyped and imputed SNPs resulted in 3 chromosomal regions with association P approximately 10(-7): 1p31.1 (no known genes), 3p21 (>25 known genes), and 5q15 (MCTP1). The most strongly associated nonsynonymous SNP rs1042779 (OR = 1.19, P = 1.8 x 10(-7)) is in the ITIH1 gene on chromosome 3, with other strongly associated nonsynonymous SNPs in GNL3, NEK4, and ITIH3. Thus, these chromosomal regions harbor genes implicated in cell cycle, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and neurosignaling. In addition, we replicated the reported ANK3 association results for SNP rs10994336 in the nonoverlapping GSK sample (OR = 1.37, P = 0.042). Although these results are promising, analysis of additional samples will be required to confirm that variant(s) in these regions influence BP risk.},

Of 34 SNPs selected for replication, 7 new rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in an analysis of all 41,282 samples. The associated SNPs are near genes of known immune function, including IL6ST, SPRED2, RBPJ, CCR6, IRF5 and PXK. We also refined associations at two established rheumatoid arthritis risk loci (IL2RA and CCL21) and confirmed the association at AFF3. These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry.

	Abstract = {The problem of testing for a centre effect in multi-centre studies following a proportional hazards regression analysis is considered. Two approaches to the problem can be used. One fits a proportional hazards model with a fixed covariate included for each centre (except one). The need for a centre specific adjustment is evaluated using either a score, Wald or likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that all the centre specific effects are equal to zero. An alternative approach is to introduce a random effect or frailty for each centre into the model. Recently, Commenges and Andersen have proposed a score test for this random effects model. By a Monte Carlo study we compare the performance of these two approaches when either the fixed or random effects model holds true. The study shows that for moderate samples the fixed effects tests have nominal levels much higher than specified, but the random effect test performs as expected under the null hypothesis. Under the alternative hypothesis the random effect test has good power to detect relatively small fixed or random centre effects. Also, if the centre effect is ignored the estimator of the main treatment effect may be quite biased and is inconsistent. The tests are illustrated on a retrospective multi-centre study of recovery from bone marrow transplantation.},

	Abstract = {In determining the role inter-study variation should play in an overview analysis, it is important to consider three factors: which question one is trying to answer; the degree of similarity or dissimilarity of design, and the degree to which heterogeneity of outcomes can be explained. Three questions one might be interested in are: whether treatment can be effective in some circumstances; whether treatment is effective on average, and whether treatment was effective on average in the trials at hand. Under the assumption of no qualitative interaction, the answers to these questions coincide. The O-E analysis most directly answers the third question. Other analyses are suggested when the first question is of interest, using the aspirin post-MI studies as an example.},

	Abstract = {Although there is evidence that greater exposure to testosterone is associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer, a recent analysis of 18 prospective studies found no relationship between levels of endogenous sex hormones and prostate cancer development. However, the reviewed studies were subject to methodological constraints that would obscure any potential relationship between prostate cancer and androgenic hormones. If prostate cancer risk is mediated by lifetime exposure to testosterone, then case-control studies that concentrate on endogenous sex hormones near the ages that prostate cancer is diagnosed would provide limited information on cumulative testosterone exposure across the lifespan. Alternately, early adulthood has been suggested as the most salient period to evaluate the influence of steroid physiology on prostate carcinogenesis. As such, an exhaustive literature search was completed to obtain testosterone values reported for study samples of younger men, along with prostate cancer incidences for the larger populations from which the study populations were sampled. A novel analytical method was developed to standardize, organize, and examine 12 studies reporting testosterone levels for 28 population samples. Study populations were generally apportioned according to ethnicity and geographic residence: Americans of African, Asian, Caucasian, and Hispanic ancestry from several different regions within the United States as well as men from China, Germany, Japan, Kuwait, New Zealand, South Korea, and Sweden. Population differences in the testosterone levels of young men were significantly associated with population disparities in the prostate cancer incidence of older men (Spearman's rho = 0.634, p = 0.002).},

	Abstract = {In Genomewide association (GWA) studies investigating thousands of SNPs, large sample sizes are needed to obtain a reasonable power after correction for multiple testing. To obtain the necessary sample sizes, data from different populations/cohorts are combined. The problem of pooling evidence across cohorts bears some resemblance with meta-analysis of clinical trials, and in fact classical meta-analytic methodologies from that field are typically used in GWAs. However, in genetics, it can be expected that the cohorts show some amount of heterogeneity in the association measures that are used for significance testing. In this paper, we demonstrate how it is possible to exploit this heterogeneity to improve our ability to detect influential genetic variants. We also discuss how pathway analysis based on summary data can help resolve heterogeneity. The current standard method for testing SNPs across cohorts in GWAs will miss heterogeneous but important genetic variants affecting complex diseases. Our new testing strategy has the potential to detect them while maintaining sensitivity to variants with homogeneous effects.},

We discuss an approach to studying population structure (principal components analysis) that was first applied to genetic data by Cavalli-Sforza and colleagues. We place the method on a solid statistical footing, using results from modern statistics to develop formal significance tests. We also uncover a general "phase change" phenomenon about the ability to detect structure in genetic data, which emerges from the statistical theory we use, and has an important implication for the ability to discover structure in genetic data: for a fixed but large dataset size, divergence between two populations (as measured, for example, by a statistic like FST) below a threshold is essentially undetectable, but a little above threshold, detection will be easy. This means that we can predict the dataset size needed to detect structure.},

	Abstract = {Today most conclusions about cumulative knowledge in psychology are based on meta-analysis. We first present an examination of the important statistical differences between fixed-effects (FE) and random-effects (RE) models in meta-analysis and between two different RE procedures, due to Hedges and Vevea, and to Hunter and Schmidt. The implications of these differences for the appropriate interpretation of published meta-analyses are explored by applying the two RE procedures to 68 meta-analyses from five large meta-analytic studies previously published in Psychological Bulletin. Under the assumption that the goal of research is generalizable knowledge, results indicated that the published FE confidence intervals (CIs) around mean effect sizes were on average 52\% narrower than their actual width, with similar results being produced by the two RE procedures. These nominal 95\% FE CIs were found to be on average 56\% CIs. Because most meta-analyses in the literature use FE models, these findings suggest that the precision of meta-analysis findings in the literature has often been substantially overstated, with important consequences for research and practice.},

	Abstract = {Genetic association studies are a powerful tool to detect genetic variants that predispose to human disease. Once an associated variant is identified, investigators are also interested in estimating the effect of the identified variant on disease risk. Estimates of the genetic effect based on new association findings tend to be upwardly biased due to a phenomenon known as the "winner's curse." Overestimation of genetic effect size in initial studies may cause follow-up studies to be underpowered and so to fail. In this paper, we quantify the impact of the winner's curse on the allele frequency difference and odds ratio estimators for one- and two-stage case-control association studies. We then propose an ascertainment-corrected maximum likelihood method to reduce the bias of these estimators. We show that overestimation of the genetic effect by the uncorrected estimator decreases as the power of the association study increases and that the ascertainment-corrected method reduces absolute bias and mean square error unless power to detect association is high.},

	Abstract = {By combining genome-wide association data from 8,130 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and 38,987 controls of European descent and following up previously unidentified meta-analysis signals in a further 34,412 cases and 59,925 controls, we identified 12 new T2D association signals with combined P<5x10(-8). These include a second independent signal at the KCNQ1 locus; the first report, to our knowledge, of an X-chromosomal association (near DUSP9); and a further instance of overlap between loci implicated in monogenic and multifactorial forms of diabetes (at HNF1A). The identified loci affect both beta-cell function and insulin action, and, overall, T2D association signals show evidence of enrichment for genes involved in cell cycle regulation. We also show that a high proportion of T2D susceptibility loci harbor independent association signals influencing apparently unrelated complex traits.},

@article{HapMap10,
	Abstract = {Despite great progress in identifying genetic variants that influence human disease, most inherited risk remains unexplained. A more complete understanding requires genome-wide studies that fully examine less common alleles in populations with a wide range of ancestry. To inform the design and interpretation of such studies, we genotyped 1.6 million common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 1,184 reference individuals from 11 global populations, and sequenced ten 100-kilobase regions in 692 of these individuals. This integrated data set of common and rare alleles, called 'HapMap 3', includes both SNPs and copy number polymorphisms (CNPs). We characterized population-specific differences among low-frequency variants, measured the improvement in imputation accuracy afforded by the larger reference panel, especially in imputing SNPs with a minor allele frequency of <or=5\%, and demonstrated the feasibility of imputing newly discovered CNPs and SNPs. This expanded public resource of genome variants in global populations supports deeper interrogation of genomic variation and its role in human disease, and serves as a step towards a high-resolution map of the landscape of human genetic variation.},

	Abstract = {Inherited genetic variation has a critical but as yet largely uncharacterized role in human disease. Here we report a public database of common variation in the human genome: more than one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which accurate and complete genotypes have been obtained in 269 DNA samples from four populations, including ten 500-kilobase regions in which essentially all information about common DNA variation has been extracted. These data document the generality of recombination hotspots, a block-like structure of linkage disequilibrium and low haplotype diversity, leading to substantial correlations of SNPs with many of their neighbours. We show how the HapMap resource can guide the design and analysis of genetic association studies, shed light on structural variation and recombination, and identify loci that may have been subject to natural selection during human evolution.},

	Abstract = {A published method for analyzing multiple 2 $\times$ 2 contingency tables arising in retrospective studies of disease is extended in application and form. Extensions of application include comparisons of age-adjusted death rates, life-table analyses, comparisons of two sets of quantal dosage-response data, and miscellaneous laboratory applications as appropriate. Extensions in form involve considering multiple contingency tables with arbitrarily many rows and/or columns, where rows and columns are orderable, and may even be on a continuous scale. The assignment of some score for each row or column is essential to use of the method. With scores assigned, a deviation of the sum of cross products from expectation, and its variance conditioned on all marginal totals, are computed for each table and a chi square is determined corresponding to the grand total of the deviations. For various specific instances and for various scoring procedures, the procedure extends or is equivalent to the asymptotic form of many known nonparametric techniques},

	Abstract = {Models for the analysis of longitudinal data must recognize the relationship between serial observations on the same unit. Multivariate models with general covariance structure are often difficult to apply to highly unbalanced data, whereas two-stage random-effects models can be used easily. In two-stage models, the probability distributions for the response vectors of different individuals belong to a single family, but some random-effects parameters vary across individuals, with a distribution specified at the second stage. A general family of models is discussed, which includes both growth models and repeated-measures models as special cases. A unified approach to fitting these models, based on a combination of empirical Bayes and maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and using the EM algorithm, is discussed. Two examples are taken from a current epidemiological study of the health effects of air pollution.},

Each review pools the results from the relevant trials in order to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition. These reviews lack consistent assessment of homogeneity of treatment effect before pooling. We discuss a random effects approach to combining evidence from a series of experiments comparing two treatments. This approach incorporates the heterogeneity of effects in the analysis of the overall treatment efficacy. The model can be extended to include relevant covariates which would reduce the heterogeneity and allow for more specific therapeutic recommendations. We suggest a simple noniterative procedure for characterizing the distribution of treatment effects in a series of studies.},

	Abstract = {Meta-analysis is essential for obtaining reproducible summaries of study results and valuable for discovering patterns among study results. A good meta-analysis will highlight and delineate the subjective components of these processes and vigorously search for sources of heterogeneity. Unfortunately, these objective are not always met by common techniques. For example, a scatterplot is an objective summarization if the data are uncensored, but inferred patterns should be regarded as subjective recognitions of the analyst, not objective data properties. Random-effects summaries encourage averaging over important data patterns, divert attention from key sources of heterogeneity, and can amplify distortions produced by publication bias; such summaries should only be used when important heterogeneity remains after a thorough search for the sources of such heterogeneity. Quality scoring adds the analyst's subjective bias to the results, wastes information, and can prevent the recognition of key sources of heterogeneity; it should be completely replaced by meta-regression on quality items (the score components).},

	Abstract = {In a meta-analysis of a set of clinical trials, a crucial but problematic component is providing an estimate and confidence interval for the overall treatment effect theta. Since in the presence of heterogeneity a fixed effect approach yields an artificially narrow confidence interval for theta, the random effects method of DerSimonian and Laird, which incorporates a moment estimator of the between-trial components of variance sigma B2, has been advocated. With the additional distributional assumptions of normality, a confidence interval for theta may be obtained. However, this method does not provide a confidence interval for sigma B2, nor a confidence interval for theta which takes account of the fact that sigma B2 has to be estimated from the data. We show how a likelihood based method can be used to overcome these problems, and use profile likelihoods to construct likelihood based confidence intervals. This approach yields an appropriately widened confidence interval compared with the standard random effects method. Examples of application to a published meta-analysis and a multicentre clinical trial are discussed. It is concluded that likelihood based methods are preferred to the standard method in undertaking random effects meta-analysis when the value of sigma B2 has an important effect on the overall estimated treatment effect.},

	Abstract = {When combining results from separate investigations in a meta-analysis, random effects methods enable the modelling of differences between studies by incorporating a heterogeneity parameter tau 2 that accounts explicitly for across-study variation. We develop a simple form for the variance of Cochran's homogeneity statistic Q, leading to interval estimation of tau 2 utilizing an approximating distribution for Q; this enables us to extend the point estimation of DerSimonian and Laird. We also develop asymptotic likelihood methods and compared them with this method. We then use these approximating distributions to give a new method of calculating the weight given to the individual studies' results when estimating the overall mean which takes into account variation in these point estimates of tau 2. Two examples illustrate the methods presented, where we show that the new weighting scheme is between the standard fixed and random effects models in down-weighting the results of large studies and up-weighting those of small studies.},

An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders.},

@article{Engels00,
	Abstract = {For meta-analysis, substantial uncertainty remains about the most appropriate statistical methods for combining the results of separate trials. An important issue for meta-analysis is how to incorporate heterogeneity, defined as variation among the results of individual trials beyond that expected from chance, into summary estimates of treatment effect. Another consideration is which 'metric' to use to measure treatment effect; for trials with binary outcomes, there are several possible metrics, including the odds ratio (a relative measure) and risk difference (an absolute measure). To examine empirically how assessment of treatment effect and heterogeneity may differ when different methods are utilized, we studied 125 meta-analyses representative of those performed by clinical investigators. There was no meta-analysis in which the summary risk difference and odds ratio were discrepant to the extent that one indicated significant benefit while the other indicated significant harm. Further, for most meta-analyses, summary odds ratios and risk differences agreed in statistical significance, leading to similar conclusions about whether treatments affected outcome. Heterogeneity was common regardless of whether treatment effects were measured by odds ratios or risk differences. However, risk differences usually displayed more heterogeneity than odds ratios. Random effects estimates, which incorporate heterogeneity, tended to be less precisely estimated than fixed effects estimates. We present two exceptions to these observations, which derive from the weights assigned to individual trial estimates. We discuss the implications of these findings for selection of a metric for meta-analysis and incorporation of heterogeneity into summary estimates. Published in 2000 by John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In this review, we describe recent empirical and theoretical work on the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome, comparing the predictions of simple population-genetic models to available data. Several studies report significant LD over distances longer than those predicted by standard models, whereas some data from short, intergenic regions show less LD than would be expected. The apparent discrepancies between theory and data present a challenge-both to modelers and to human geneticists-to identify which important features are missing from our understanding of the biological processes that give rise to LD. Salient features may include demographic complications such as recent admixture, as well as genetic factors such as local variation in recombination rates, gene conversion, and the potential segregation of inversions. We also outline some implications that the emerging patterns of LD have for association-mapping strategies. In particular, we discuss what marker densities might be necessary for genomewide association scans.},

@article{Higgins02,
	Abstract = {The extent of heterogeneity in a meta-analysis partly determines the difficulty in drawing overall conclusions. This extent may be measured by estimating a between-study variance, but interpretation is then specific to a particular treatment effect metric. A test for the existence of heterogeneity exists, but depends on the number of studies in the meta-analysis. We develop measures of the impact of heterogeneity on a meta-analysis, from mathematical criteria, that are independent of the number of studies and the treatment effect metric. We derive and propose three suitable statistics: H is the square root of the chi2 heterogeneity statistic divided by its degrees of freedom; R is the ratio of the standard error of the underlying mean from a random effects meta-analysis to the standard error of a fixed effect meta-analytic estimate, and I2 is a transformation of (H) that describes the proportion of total variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity. We discuss interpretation, interval estimates and other properties of these measures and examine them in five example data sets showing different amounts of heterogeneity. We conclude that H and I2, which can usually be calculated for published meta-analyses, are particularly useful summaries of the impact of heterogeneity. One or both should be presented in published meta-analyses in preference to the test for heterogeneity.},

@article{Schaid02,
	Abstract = {A key step toward the discovery of a gene related to a trait is the finding of an association between the trait and one or more haplotypes. Haplotype analyses can also provide critical information regarding the function of a gene; however, when unrelated subjects are sampled, haplotypes are often ambiguous because of unknown linkage phase of the measured sites along a chromosome. A popular method of accounting for this ambiguity in case-control studies uses a likelihood that depends on haplotype frequencies, so that the haplotype frequencies can be compared between the cases and controls; however, this traditional method is limited to a binary trait (case vs. control), and it does not provide a method of testing the statistical significance of specific haplotypes. To address these limitations, we developed new methods of testing the statistical association between haplotypes and a wide variety of traits, including binary, ordinal, and quantitative traits. Our methods allow adjustment for nongenetic covariates, which may be critical when analyzing genetically complex traits. Furthermore, our methods provide several different global tests for association, as well as haplotype-specific tests, which give a meaningful advantage in attempts to understand the roles of many different haplotypes. The statistics can be computed rapidly, making it feasible to evaluate the associations between many haplotypes and a trait. To illustrate the use of our new methods, they are applied to a study of the association of haplotypes (composed of genes from the human-leukocyte-antigen complex) with humoral immune response to measles vaccination. Limited simulations are also presented to demonstrate the validity of our methods, as well as to provide guidelines on how our methods could be used.},

	Abstract = {With the increase in genomewide experiments and the sequencing of multiple genomes, the analysis of large data sets has become commonplace in biology. It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

@article{Patterson04,
	Abstract = {Admixture mapping (also known as "mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium," or MALD) has been proposed as an efficient approach to localizing disease-causing variants that differ in frequency (because of either drift or selection) between two historically separated populations. Near a disease gene, patient populations descended from the recent mixing of two or more ethnic groups should have an increased probability of inheriting the alleles derived from the ethnic group that carries more disease-susceptibility alleles. The central attraction of admixture mapping is that, since gene flow has occurred recently in modern populations (e.g., in African and Hispanic Americans in the past 20 generations), it is expected that admixture-generated linkage disequilibrium should extend for many centimorgans. High-resolution marker sets are now becoming available to test this approach, but progress will require (a). computational methods to infer ancestral origin at each point in the genome and (b). empirical characterization of the general properties of linkage disequilibrium due to admixture. Here we describe statistical methods to estimate the ancestral origin of a locus on the basis of the composite genotypes of linked markers, and we show that this approach accurately estimates states of ancestral origin along the genome. We apply this approach to show that strong admixture linkage disequilibrium extends, on average, for 17 cM in African Americans. Finally, we present power calculations under varying models of disease risk, sample size, and proportions of ancestry. Studying approximately 2500 markers in approximately 2500 patients should provide power to detect many regions contributing to common disease. A particularly important result is that the power of an admixture mapping study to detect a locus will be nearly the same for a wide range of mixture scenarios: the mixture proportion should be 10\%-90\% from both ancestral populations.},

	Abstract = {Correlated multiple testing is widely performed in genetic research, particularly in multilocus analyses of complex diseases. Failure to control appropriately for the effect of multiple testing will either result in a flood of false-positive claims or in true hits being overlooked. Cheverud proposed the idea of adjusting correlated tests as if they were independent, according to an 'effective number' (M(eff)) of independent tests. However, our experience has indicated that Cheverud's estimate of the Meff is overly large and will lead to excessively conservative results. We propose a more accurate estimate of the M(eff), and design M(eff)-based procedures to control the experiment-wise significant level and the false discovery rate. In an evaluation, based on both real and simulated data, the M(eff)-based procedures were able to control the error rate accurately and consequently resulted in a power increase, especially in multilocus analyses. The results confirm that the M(eff) is a useful concept in the error-rate control of correlated tests. With its efficiency and accuracy, the M(eff) method provides an alternative to computationally intensive methods such as the permutation test.},

@article{Browning06,
	Abstract = {I propose a new method for association-based gene mapping that makes powerful use of multilocus data, is computationally efficient, and is straightforward to apply over large genomic regions. The approach is based on the fitting of variable-length Markov chain models, which automatically adapt to the degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between markers to create a parsimonious model for the LD structure. Edges of the fitted graph are tested for association with trait status. This approach can be thought of as haplotype testing with sophisticated windowing that accounts for extent of LD to reduce degrees of freedom and number of tests while maximizing information. I present analyses of two published data sets that show that this approach can have better power than single-marker tests or sliding-window haplotypic tests.},

@article{Kimmel06,
	Abstract = {Because of rapid progress in genotyping techniques, many large-scale, genomewide disease-association studies are now under way. Typically, the disorders examined are multifactorial, and, therefore, researchers seeking association must consider interactions among loci and between loci and other factors. One of the challenges of large disease-association studies is obtaining accurate estimates of the significance of discovered associations. The linkage disequilibrium between SNPs makes the tests highly dependent, and dependency worsens when interactions are tested. The standard way of assigning significance (P value) is by a permutation test. Unfortunately, in large studies, it is prohibitively slow to compute low P values by this method. We present here a faster algorithm for accurately calculating low P values in case-control association studies. Unlike with several previous methods, we do not assume a specific distribution of the traits, given the genotypes. Our method is based on importance sampling and on accounting for the decay in linkage disequilibrium along the chromosome. The algorithm is dramatically faster than the standard permutation test. On data sets mimicking medium-to-large association studies, it speeds up computation by a factor of 5,000-100,000, sometimes reducing running times from years to minutes. Thus, our method significantly increases the problem-size range for which accurate, meaningful association results are attainable.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the genetic variants that increase the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in humans has been a formidable challenge. Adopting a genome-wide association strategy, we genotyped 1161 Finnish T2D cases and 1174 Finnish normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) controls with >315,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and imputed genotypes for an additional >2 million autosomal SNPs. We carried out association analysis with these SNPs to identify genetic variants that predispose to T2D, compared our T2D association results with the results of two similar studies, and genotyped 80 SNPs in an additional 1215 Finnish T2D cases and 1258 Finnish NGT controls. We identify T2D-associated variants in an intergenic region of chromosome 11p12, contribute to the identification of T2D-associated variants near the genes IGF2BP2 and CDKAL1 and the region of CDKN2A and CDKN2B, and confirm that variants near TCF7L2, SLC30A8, HHEX, FTO, PPARG, and KCNJ11 are associated with T2D risk. This brings the number of T2D loci now confidently identified to at least 10.},

@article{Riley07,
	Abstract = {Often multiple outcomes are of interest in each study identified by a systematic review, and in this situation a separate univariate meta-analysis is usually applied to synthesize the evidence for each outcome independently; an alternative approach is a single multivariate meta-analysis model that utilizes any correlation between outcomes and obtains all the pooled estimates jointly. Surprisingly, multivariate meta-analysis is rarely considered in practice, so in this paper we illustrate the benefits and limitations of the approach to provide helpful insight for practitioners. We compare a bivariate random-effects meta-analysis (BRMA) to two independent univariate random-effects meta-analyses (URMA), and show how and why a BRMA is able to 'borrow strength' across outcomes. Then, on application to two examples in healthcare, we show: (i) given complete data for both outcomes in each study, BRMA is likely to produce individual pooled estimates with very similar standard errors to those from URMA; (ii) given some studies where one of the outcomes is missing at random, the 'borrowing of strength' is likely to allow BRMA to produce individual pooled estimates with noticeably smaller standard errors than those from URMA; (iii) for either complete data or missing data, BRMA will produce a more appropriate standard error of the pooled difference between outcomes as it incorporates their correlation, which is not possible using URMA; and (iv) despite its advantages, BRMA may often not be possible due to the difficulty in obtaining the within-study correlations required to fit the model. Bivariate meta-regression and further research priorities are also discussed.},

One of these challenges is haplotype inference; methods for haplotype inference designed for small data sets from candidate-gene studies do not scale well to the large number of individuals genotyped in whole-genome association studies. We present a new method and software for inference of haplotype phase and missing data that can accurately phase data from whole-genome association studies, and we present the first comparison of haplotype-inference methods for real and simulated data sets with thousands of genotyped individuals. We find that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and accuracy for large data sets with thousands of individuals and densely spaced genetic markers, and we use our method to phase a real data set of 3,002 individuals genotyped for 490,032 markers in 3.1 days of computing time, with 99\% of masked alleles imputed correctly. Our method is implemented in the Beagle software package, which is freely available.},

	Abstract = {A dense map of genetic variation in the laboratory mouse genome will provide insights into the evolutionary history of the species and lead to an improved understanding of the relationship between inter-strain genotypic and phenotypic differences. Here we resequence the genomes of four wild-derived and eleven classical strains. We identify 8.27 million high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) densely distributed across the genome, and determine the locations of the high (divergent subspecies ancestry) and low (common subspecies ancestry) SNP-rate intervals for every pairwise combination of classical strains. Using these data, we generate a genome-wide haplotype map containing 40,898 segments, each with an average of three distinct ancestral haplotypes. For the haplotypes in the classical strains that are unequivocally assigned ancestry, the genetic contributions of the Mus musculus subspecies--M. m. domesticus, M. m. musculus, M. m. castaneus and the hybrid M. m. molossinus--are 68\%, 6\%, 3\% and 10\%, respectively; the remaining 13\% of haplotypes are of unknown ancestral origin. The considerable regional redundancy of the SNP data will facilitate imputation of the majority of these genotypes in less-densely typed classical inbred strains to provide a complete view of variation in additional strains.},

We identified and confirmed association of a SNP in an intron of glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) with serum triglycerides.

@article{Ioannidis07,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Meta-analysis is the systematic and quantitative synthesis of effect sizes and the exploration of their diversity across different studies. Meta-analyses are increasingly applied to synthesize data from genome-wide association (GWA) studies and from other teams that try to replicate the genetic variants that emerge from such investigations. Between-study heterogeneity is important to document and may point to interesting leads. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To exemplify these issues, we used data from three GWA studies on type 2 diabetes and their replication efforts where meta-analyses of all data using fixed effects methods (not incorporating between-study heterogeneity) have already been published. We considered 11 polymorphisms that at least one of the three teams has suggested as susceptibility loci for type 2 diabetes. The I2 inconsistency metric (measuring the amount of heterogeneity not due to chance) was different from 0 (no detectable heterogeneity) for 6 of the 11 genetic variants; inconsistency was moderate to very large (I2 = 32-77\%) for 5 of them. For these 5 polymorphisms, random effects calculations incorporating between-study heterogeneity revealed more conservative p-values for the summary effects compared with the fixed effects calculations. These 5 associations were perused in detail to highlight potential explanations for between-study heterogeneity. These include identification of a marker for a correlated phenotype (e.g. FTO rs8050136 being associated with type 2 diabetes through its effect on obesity); differential linkage disequilibrium across studies of the identified genetic markers with the respective culprit polymorphisms (e.g., possibly the case for CDKAL1 polymorphisms or for rs9300039 and markers in linkage disequilibrium, as shown by additional studies); and potential bias. Results were largely similar, when we treated the discovery and replication data from each GWA investigation as separate studies. SIGNIFICANCE: Between-study heterogeneity is useful to document in the synthesis of data from GWA investigations and can offer valuable insights for further clarification of gene-disease associations.},

We detected diabetes susceptibility loci in and around the genes CDKAL1, CDKN2A/CDKN2B, and IGF2BP2 and confirmed the recently described associations at HHEX/IDE and SLC30A8. Our findings provide insight into the genetic architecture of type 2 diabetes, emphasizing the contribution of multiple variants of modest effect.

The models are two conventional models, namely a multi-level and a model based upon an approximate likelihood, and a newly developed model, the profile likelihood model which might be viewed as an extension of the Mantel-Haenszel approach. To exemplify these methods, we use results from a meta-analysis of 22 trials to prevent respiratory tract infections. We show that by using the multi-level approach, in the case of baseline heterogeneity, the number of clusters or components is considerably over-estimated. The approximate and profile likelihood method showed nearly the same pattern for the treatment effect distribution. To provide more evidence two simulation studies are accomplished. The profile likelihood can be considered as a clear alternative to the approximate likelihood model. In the case of strong baseline heterogeneity, the profile likelihood method shows superior behaviour when compared with the multi-level model.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alternative methods for individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of time-to-event outcomes have been established and utilized in practice. The most common approach is a stratified log-rank analysis. The IPD approach is considered to be the gold standard approach for meta-analysis and is becoming increasingly more popular but the performance of different methods has not been studied previously. PURPOSE: To compare commonly used methods for fixed effects meta-analysis of individual patient time-to-event data. METHODS: The stratified log-rank analysis, an inverse variance weighted average of Cox model estimates, and the stratified Cox regression model are compared. First, a theoretical comparison of approaches is undertaken. Second, the bias and coverage are assessed for the pooled hazard ratio using simulated data under commonly encountered meta-analysis conditions. Finally, a comparison is presented using empirical data from four separate systematic reviews of anti-epileptic drug trials where IPD are available for two time-to-event outcomes. RESULTS: For hazard ratio close to 1 with minimal heterogeneity between trials, theoretical results suggest similar results should be expected from all the three methods. Results for empirical and simulated data are in keeping with the theoretical results and show all the three methods perform well under these conditions. When there is no heterogeneity and the proportional hazards assumption holds, the stratified Cox model and inverse variance weighted average produce similar estimates of the pooled treatment effect and are to be preferred to the stratified log-rank analysis when the underlying treatment effect is large. Coverage values diminish for all the three methods and are below 95\% for low or moderate heterogeneity. The low coverage values highlight the need for models that appropriately account for or explore the between trial variation. LIMITATIONS: Until larger simulations can be undertaken, conclusions based on the simulated and empirical data should only be applied to small meta-analyses of four or five trials. CONCLUSIONS: These investigations suggest that under normal conditions all three methods provide similar results. For moderate heterogeneity coverage for all the three fixed effects models depreciates.},

A central challenge in this area is the development of powerful multipoint methods that can detect causal variants that have not been directly genotyped. We propose a coherent analysis framework that treats the problem as one involving missing or uncertain genotypes. Central to our approach is a model-based imputation method for inferring genotypes at observed or unobserved SNPs, leading to improved power over existing methods for multipoint association mapping. Using real genome-wide association study data, we show that our approach (i) is accurate and well calibrated, (ii) provides detailed views of associated regions that facilitate follow-up studies and (iii) can be used to validate and correct data at genotyped markers. A notable future use of our method will be to boost power by combining data from genome-wide scans that use different SNP sets.},

@article{Evangelou07,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genome-wide association studies hold substantial promise for identifying common genetic variants that regulate susceptibility to complex diseases. However, for the detection of small genetic effects, single studies may be underpowered. Power may be improved by combining genome-wide datasets with meta-analytic techniques. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Both single and two-stage genome-wide data may be combined and there are several possible strategies. In the two-stage framework, we considered the options of (1) enhancement of replication data and (2) enhancement of first-stage data, and then, we also considered (3) joint meta-analyses including all first-stage and second-stage data. These strategies were examined empirically using data from two genome-wide association studies (three datasets) on Parkinson disease. In the three strategies, we derived 12, 5, and 49 single nucleotide polymorphisms that show significant associations at conventional levels of statistical significance. None of these remained significant after conservative adjustment for the number of performed analyses in each strategy. However, some may warrant further consideration: 6 SNPs were identified with at least 2 of the 3 strategies and 3 SNPs [rs1000291 on chromosome 3, rs2241743 on chromosome 4 and rs3018626 on chromosome 11] were identified with all 3 strategies and had no or minimal between-dataset heterogeneity (I(2) = 0, 0 and 15\%, respectively). Analyses were primarily limited by the suboptimal overlap of tested polymorphisms across different datasets (e.g., only 31,192 shared polymorphisms between the two tier 1 datasets). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Meta-analysis may be used to improve the power and examine the between-dataset heterogeneity of genome-wide association studies. Prospective designs may be most efficient, if they try to maximize the overlap of genotyping platforms and anticipate the combination of data across many genome-wide association studies.},

	Abstract = {The random-effects model is often used for meta-analysis of clinical studies. The method explicitly accounts for the heterogeneity of studies through a statistical parameter representing the inter-study variation. We discuss several iterative and non-iterative alternative methods for estimating the inter-study variance and hence the overall population treatment effect. We show that the leading methods for estimating the inter-study variance are special cases of a general method-of-moments estimate of the inter-study variance. The general method suggests two new two-step methods. The iterative estimate is statistically optimal and it can be easily calculated on a spreadsheet program, such as Microsoft Excel, available on the desktop of most researchers. The two-step methods approximate the optimal iterative method better than the earlier one-step non-iterative methods.},

We show that whole genome haplotypic association testing with permutation to account for multiple testing is statistically powerful and computationally feasible on such data, using an efficient software implementation of a recently proposed method. We use realistic simulations to explore the statistical properties of the method, and show that for ungenotyped disease-susceptibility variants with population frequencies of 5\% or less the haplotypic tests have markedly better power than single-marker tests. We propose a combined single-marker and haplotypic strategy, in which both single-marker and haplotypic tests are applied, with the minimum P-value adjusted for multiple testing by permutation which results in a test that is powerful for detecting both low-and high-frequency disease-susceptibility variants.},

@article{WTCCC07,
	Abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

	Abstract = {Meta-analysis offers the opportunity to combine evidence from retrospectively accumulated or prospectively generated data. Meta-analyses may provide summary estimates and can help in detecting and addressing potential inconsistency between the combined datasets. Application of meta-analysis in genetic associations presents considerable potential and several pitfalls. In this review, we present basic principles of meta-analytic methods, adapted for human genome epidemiology. We describe issues that arise in the retrospective or the prospective collection of relevant data through various sources, common traps to consider in the appraisal of evidence and potential biases that may interfere. We describe the relative merits and caveats for common methods used to trace inconsistency across studies along with possible reasons for non-replication of proposed associations. Different statistical models may be employed to combine data and some common misconceptions may arise in the process. Several meta-analysis diagnostics are often applied or misapplied in the literature, and we comment on their use and limitations. An alternative to overcome limitations arising from retrospective combination of data from published studies is to create networks of research teams working in the same field and perform collaborative meta-analyses of individual participant data, ideally on a prospective basis. We discuss the advantages and the challenges inherent in such collaborative approaches. Meta-analysis can be a useful tool in dissecting the genetics of complex diseases and traits, provided its methods are properly applied and interpreted.},

@article{Han08,
	Abstract = {Discovering statistical correlation between causal genetic variation and clinical traits through association studies is an important method for identifying the genetic basis of human diseases. Since fully resequencing a cohort is prohibitively costly, genetic association studies take advantage of local correlation structure (or linkage disequilibrium) between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by selecting a subset of SNPs to be genotyped (tag SNPs). While many current association studies are performed using commercially available high-throughput genotyping products that define a set of tag SNPs, choosing tag SNPs remains an important problem for both custom follow-up studies as well as designing the high-throughput genotyping products themselves. The most widely used tag SNP selection method optimizes the correlation between SNPs (r(2)). However, tag SNPs chosen based on an r(2) criterion do not necessarily maximize the statistical power of an association study. We propose a study design framework that chooses SNPs to maximize power and efficiently measures the power through empirical simulation. Empirical results based on the HapMap data show that our method gains considerable power over a widely used r(2)-based method, or equivalently reduces the number of tag SNPs required to attain the desired power of a study. Our power-optimized 100k whole genome tag set provides equivalent power to the Affymetrix 500k chip for the CEU population. For the design of custom follow-up studies, our method provides up to twice the power increase using the same number of tag SNPs as r(2)-based methods. Our method is publicly available via web server at http://design.cs.ucla.edu.},

@article{Bansal08,
	Abstract = {In comparison to genotypes, knowledge about haplotypes (the combination of alleles present on a single chromosome) is much more useful for whole-genome association studies and for making inferences about human evolutionary history. Haplotypes are typically inferred from population genotype data using computational methods. Whole-genome sequence data represent a promising resource for constructing haplotypes spanning hundreds of kilobases for an individual. In this article, we propose a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, HASH (haplotype assembly for single human), for assembling haplotypes from sequenced DNA fragments that have been mapped to a reference genome assembly. The transitions of the Markov chain are generated using min-cut computations on graphs derived from the sequenced fragments. We have applied our method to infer haplotypes using whole-genome shotgun sequence data from a recently sequenced human individual. The high sequence coverage and presence of mate pairs result in fairly long haplotypes (N50 length ~ 350 kb). Based on comparison of the sequenced fragments against the individual haplotypes, we demonstrate that the haplotypes for this individual inferred using HASH are significantly more accurate than the haplotypes estimated using a previously proposed greedy heuristic and a simple MCMC method. Using haplotypes from the HapMap project, we estimate the switch error rate of the haplotypes inferred using HASH to be quite low, ~1.1\%. Our Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm represents a general framework for haplotype assembly that can be applied to sequence data generated by other sequencing technologies. The code implementing the methods and the phased individual haplotypes can be downloaded from (http://www.cse.ucsd.edu/users/vibansal/HASH/).},

@article{Browning08,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Large-scale genetic association studies can test hundreds of thousands of genetic markers for association with a trait. Since the genetic markers may be correlated, a Bonferroni correction is typically too stringent a correction for multiple testing. Permutation testing is a standard statistical technique for determining statistical significance when performing multiple correlated tests for genetic association. However, permutation testing for large-scale genetic association studies is computationally demanding and calls for optimized algorithms and software. PRESTO is a new software package for genetic association studies that performs fast computation of multiple-testing adjusted P-values via permutation of the trait. RESULTS: PRESTO is an order of magnitude faster than other existing permutation testing software, and can analyze a large genome-wide association study (500 K markers, 5 K individuals, 1 K permutations) in approximately one hour of computing time. PRESTO has several unique features that are useful in a wide range of studies: it reports empirical null distributions for the top-ranked statistics (i.e. order statistics), it performs user-specified combinations of allelic and genotypic tests, it performs stratified analysis when sampled individuals are from multiple populations and each individual's population of origin is specified, and it determines significance levels for one and two-stage genotyping designs. PRESTO is designed for case-control studies, but can also be applied to trio data (parents and affected offspring) if transmitted parental alleles are coded as case alleles and untransmitted parental alleles are coded as control alleles. CONCLUSION: PRESTO is a platform-independent software package that performs fast and flexible permutation testing for genetic association studies. The PRESTO executable file, Java source code, example data, and documentation are freely available at http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~browning/presto/presto.html.},

We identified four previously unreported CRC risk loci at 14q22.2 (rs4444235, BMP4; P = 8.1 x 10(-10)), 16q22.1 (rs9929218, CDH1; P = 1.2 x 10(-8)), 19q13.1 (rs10411210, RHPN2; P = 4.6 x 10(-9)) and 20p12.3 (rs961253; P = 2.0 x 10(-10)). These findings underscore the value of large sample series for discovery and follow-up of genetic variants contributing to the etiology of CRC.},

	Abstract = {The presence of genotyping errors can invalidate statistical tests for linkage and disease association, particularly for methods based on haplotype analysis. Becker et al. have recently proposed a simple likelihood ratio approach for detecting errors in trio genotype data. Under this approach, a SNP genotype is flagged as a potential error if the likelihood associated with the original trio genotype data increases by a multiplicative factor exceeding a user selected threshold when the SNP genotype under test is deleted. In this article we give improved error detection methods using the likelihood ratio test approach in conjunction with likelihood functions that can be efficiently computed based on a Hidden Markov Model of haplotype diversity in the population under study. Experimental results on both simulated and real datasets show that proposed methods have highly scalable running time and achieve significantly improved detection accuracy compared to previous methods.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple loci at which common variants modestly but reproducibly influence risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Established associations to common and rare variants explain only a small proportion of the heritability of T2D. As previously published analyses had limited power to identify variants with modest effects, we carried out meta-analysis of three T2D GWA scans comprising 10,128 individuals of European descent and approximately 2.2 million SNPs (directly genotyped and imputed), followed by replication testing in an independent sample with an effective sample size of up to 53,975. We detected at least six previously unknown loci with robust evidence for association, including the JAZF1 (P = 5.0 x 10(-14)), CDC123-CAMK1D (P = 1.2 x 10(-10)), TSPAN8-LGR5 (P = 1.1 x 10(-9)), THADA (P = 1.1 x 10(-9)), ADAMTS9 (P = 1.2 x 10(-8)) and NOTCH2 (P = 4.1 x 10(-8)) gene regions.

@article{Bansal08a,
	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: The goal of the haplotype assembly problem is to reconstruct the two haplotypes (chromosomes) for an individual using a mix of sequenced fragments from the two chromosomes. This problem has been shown to be computationally intractable for various optimization criteria. Polynomial time algorithms have been proposed for restricted versions of the problem. In this article, we consider the haplotype assembly problem in the most general setting, i.e. fragments of any length and with an arbitrary number of gaps. RESULTS: We describe a novel combinatorial approach for the haplotype assembly problem based on computing max-cuts in certain graphs derived from the sequenced fragments. Levy et al. have sequenced the complete genome of a human individual and used a greedy heuristic to assemble the haplotypes for this individual. We have applied our method HapCUTto infer haplotypes from this data and demonstrate that the haplotypes inferred using HapCUT are significantly more accurate (20-25\% lower maximum error correction scores for all chromosomes) than the greedy heuristic and a previously published method, Fast Hare. We also describe a maximum likelihood based estimator of the absolute accuracy of the sequence-based haplotypes using population haplotypes from the International HapMap project.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of discovering novel non-coding RNA (ncRNA) using primary sequence, and secondary structure conservation, focusing on ncRNA families with pseudoknotted structures. Our main technical result is an efficient algorithm for computing an optimum structural alignment of an RNA sequence against a genomic substring. This algorithm has two applications. First, by scanning a genome, we can identify novel (homologous) pseudoknotted ncRNA, and second, we can infer the secondary structure of the target aligned sequence. We test an implementation of our algorithm (PAL) and show that it has near-perfect behavior for predicting the structure of many known pseudoknots. Additionally, it can detect the true homologs with high sensitivity and specificity in controlled tests. We also use PAL to search entire viral genome and mouse genome for novel homologs of some viral and eukaryotic pseudoknots, respectively. In each case, we have found strong support for novel homologs.},

	Abstract = {It is commonly assumed that random effects in hierarchical models follow a normal distribution. This can be extremely restrictive in practice. We explore the use of more flexible alternatives for this assumption, namely the t distribution, and skew extensions to the normal and t distributions, implemented using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Models are compared in terms of parameter estimates, deviance information criteria, and predictive distributions. These methods are applied to examples in meta-analysis and health-professional variation, where the distribution of the random effects is of direct interest. The results highlight the importance of allowing for potential skewing and heavy tails in random-effects distributions, especially when estimating a predictive distribution. We describe the extension of these random-effects models to the bivariate case, with application to a meta-analysis examining the relationship between treatment effect and baseline response. We conclude that inferences regarding the random effects can crucially depend on the assumptions made and recommend using a distribution, such as those suggested here, which is more flexible than the normal.},

@article{Moskvina08,
	Abstract = {The interpretation of the results of large association studies encompassing much or all of the human genome faces the fundamental statistical problem that a correspondingly large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms markers will be spuriously flagged as significant. A common method of dealing with these false positives is to raise the significance level for the individual tests for association of each marker. Any such adjustment for multiple testing is ultimately based on a more or less precise estimate for the actual overall type I error probability. We estimate this probability for association tests for correlated markers and show that it depends in a nonlinear way on the significance level for the individual tests. This dependence of the effective number of tests is not taken into account by existing multiple-testing corrections, leading to widely overestimated results. We demonstrate a simple correction for multiple testing, which can easily be calculated from the pairwise correlation and gives far more realistic estimates for the effective number of tests than previous formulae. The calculation is considerably faster than with other methods and hence applicable on a genome-wide scale. The efficacy of our method is shown on a constructed example with highly correlated markers as well as on real data sets, including a full genome scan where a conservative estimate only 8\% above the permutation estimate is obtained in about 1\% of computation time. As the calculation is based on pairwise correlations between markers, it can be performed at the stage of study design using public databases.},

	Abstract = {Multiple testing is a challenging issue in genetic association studies using large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, many of which exhibit linkage disequilibrium (LD). Failure to adjust for multiple testing appropriately may produce excessive false positives or overlook true positive signals. The Bonferroni method of adjusting for multiple comparisons is easy to compute, but is well known to be conservative in the presence of LD. On the other hand, permutation-based corrections can correctly account for LD among SNPs, but are computationally intensive. In this work, we propose a new multiple testing correction method for association studies using SNP markers. We show that it is simple, fast and more accurate than the recently developed methods and is comparable to permutation-based corrections using both simulated and real data. We also demonstrate how it might be used in whole-genome association studies to control type I error. The efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method make it an attractive choice for multiple testing adjustment when there is high intermarker LD in the SNP data set.},

	Abstract = {Genetic effects for common variants affecting complex disease risk are subtle. Single genome-wide association (GWA) studies are typically underpowered to detect these effects, and combination of several GWA data sets is needed to enhance discovery. The authors investigated the properties of the discovery process in simulated cumulative meta-analyses of GWA study-derived signals allowing for potential genetic model misspecification and between-study heterogeneity. Variants with null effects on average (but also between-data set heterogeneity) could yield false-positive associations with seemingly homogeneous effects. Random effects had higher than appropriate false-positive rates when there were few data sets. The log-additive model had the lowest false-positive rate. Under heterogeneity, random-effects meta-analyses of 2-10 data sets averaging 1,000 cases/1,000 controls each did not increase power, or the meta-analysis was even less powerful than a single study (power desert). Upward bias in effect estimates and underestimation of between-study heterogeneity were common. Fixed-effects calculations avoided power deserts and maximized discovery of association signals at the expense of much higher false-positive rates. Therefore, random- and fixed-effects models are preferable for different purposes (fixed effects for initial screenings, random effects for generalizability applications). These results may have broader implications for the design and interpretation of large-scale multiteam collaborative studies discovering common gene variants.},

	Abstract = {Bipolar disorder (BP) is a disabling and often life-threatening disorder that affects approximately 1\% of the population worldwide. To identify genetic variants that increase the risk of BP, we genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 Beadchip 2,076 bipolar cases and 1,676 controls of European ancestry from the National Institute of Mental Health Human Genetics Initiative Repository, and the Prechter Repository and samples collected in London, Toronto, and Dundee. We imputed SNP genotypes and tested for SNP-BP association in each sample and then performed meta-analysis across samples. The strongest association P value for this 2-study meta-analysis was 2.4 x 10(-6). We next imputed SNP genotypes and tested for SNP-BP association based on the publicly available Affymetrix 500K genotype data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium for 1,868 BP cases and a reference set of 12,831 individuals. A 3-study meta-analysis of 3,683 nonoverlapping cases and 14,507 extended controls on >2.3 M genotyped and imputed SNPs resulted in 3 chromosomal regions with association P approximately 10(-7): 1p31.1 (no known genes), 3p21 (>25 known genes), and 5q15 (MCTP1). The most strongly associated nonsynonymous SNP rs1042779 (OR = 1.19, P = 1.8 x 10(-7)) is in the ITIH1 gene on chromosome 3, with other strongly associated nonsynonymous SNPs in GNL3, NEK4, and ITIH3. Thus, these chromosomal regions harbor genes implicated in cell cycle, neurogenesis, neuroplasticity, and neurosignaling. In addition, we replicated the reported ANK3 association results for SNP rs10994336 in the nonoverlapping GSK sample (OR = 1.37, P = 0.042). Although these results are promising, analysis of additional samples will be required to confirm that variant(s) in these regions influence BP risk.},

@article{Gao09,
	Abstract = {A major challenge in genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is to derive the multiple testing threshold when hypothesis tests are conducted using a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms. Permutation tests are considered the gold standard in multiple testing adjustment in genetic association studies. However, it is computationally intensive, especially for GWASs, and can be impractical if a large number of random shuffles are used to ensure accuracy. Many researchers have developed approximation algorithms to relieve the computing burden imposed by permutation. One particularly attractive alternative to permutation is to calculate the effective number of independent tests, M(eff), which has been shown to be promising in genetic association studies. In this study, we compare recently developed M(eff) methods and validate them by the permutation test with 10,000 random shuffles using two real GWAS data sets: an Illumina 1M BeadChip and an Affymetrix GeneChip((R)) Human Mapping 500K Array Set. Our results show that the simpleM method produces the best approximation of the permutation threshold, and it does so in the shortest amount of time. We also show that M(eff) is indeed valid on a genome-wide scale in these data sets based on statistical theory and significance tests. The significance thresholds derived can provide practical guidelines for other studies using similar population samples and genotyping platforms. Genet. Epidemiol. 2009. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Higgins09,
	Abstract = {Meta-analysis in the presence of unexplained heterogeneity is frequently undertaken by using a random-effects model, in which the effects underlying different studies are assumed to be drawn from a normal distribution. Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of 'set shifting' ability in people with eating disorders.},

@article{Howie09,
	Abstract = {Genotype imputation methods are now being widely used in the analysis of genome-wide association studies. Most imputation analyses to date have used the HapMap as a reference dataset, but new reference panels (such as controls genotyped on multiple SNP chips and densely typed samples from the 1,000 Genomes Project) will soon allow a broader range of SNPs to be imputed with higher accuracy, thereby increasing power. We describe a genotype imputation method (IMPUTE version 2) that is designed to address the challenges presented by these new datasets. The main innovation of our approach is a flexible modelling framework that increases accuracy and combines information across multiple reference panels while remaining computationally feasible. We find that IMPUTE v2 attains higher accuracy than other methods when the HapMap provides the sole reference panel, but that the size of the panel constrains the improvements that can be made. We also find that imputation accuracy can be greatly enhanced by expanding the reference panel to contain thousands of chromosomes and that IMPUTE v2 outperforms other methods in this setting at both rare and common SNPs, with overall error rates that are 15\%-20\% lower than those of the closest competing method. One particularly challenging aspect of next-generation association studies is to integrate information across multiple reference panels genotyped on different sets of SNPs; we show that our approach to this problem has practical advantages over other suggested solutions.},

@article{Huang09,
	Abstract = {A current approach to mapping complex-disease-susceptibility loci in genome-wide association (GWA) studies involves leveraging the information in a reference database of dense genotype data. By modeling the patterns of linkage disequilibrium in a reference panel, genotypes not directly measured in the study samples can be imputed and tested for disease association. This imputation strategy has been successful for GWA studies in populations well represented by existing reference panels. We used genotypes at 513,008 autosomal single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci in 443 unrelated individuals from 29 worldwide populations to evaluate the "portability" of the HapMap reference panels for imputation in studies of diverse populations. When a single HapMap panel was leveraged for imputation of randomly masked genotypes, European populations had the highest imputation accuracy, followed by populations from East Asia, Central and South Asia, the Americas, Oceania, the Middle East, and Africa. For each population, we identified "optimal" mixtures of reference panels that maximized imputation accuracy, and we found that in most populations, mixtures including individuals from at least two HapMap panels produced the highest imputation accuracy. From a separate survey of additional SNPs typed in the same samples, we evaluated imputation accuracy in the scenario in which all genotypes at a given SNP position were unobserved and were imputed on the basis of data from a commercial "SNP chip," again finding that most populations benefited from the use of combinations of two or more HapMap reference panels. Our results can serve as a guide for selecting appropriate reference panels for imputation-based GWA analysis in diverse populations.},

Meta-analysis of many genome-wide association studies improves the power to detect more associations, and to investigate the consistency or heterogeneity of these associations across diverse datasets and study populations. In this review, we discuss the key methodological issues in the set-up, information gathering and processing, and analysis of meta-analyses of genome-wide association datasets.

	Abstract = {To identify genetic loci influencing central obesity and fat distribution, we performed a meta-analysis of 16 genome-wide association studies (GWAS, N = 38,580) informative for adult waist circumference (WC) and waist-hip ratio (WHR). We selected 26 SNPs for follow-up, for which the evidence of association with measures of central adiposity (WC and/or WHR) was strong and disproportionate to that for overall adiposity or height. Follow-up studies in a maximum of 70,689 individuals identified two loci strongly associated with measures of central adiposity; these map near TFAP2B (WC, P = 1.9x10(-11)) and MSRA (WC, P = 8.9x10(-9)). A third locus, near LYPLAL1, was associated with WHR in women only (P = 2.6x10(-8)). The variants near TFAP2B appear to influence central adiposity through an effect on overall obesity/fat-mass, whereas LYPLAL1 displays a strong female-only association with fat distribution. By focusing on anthropometric measures of central obesity and fat distribution, we have identified three loci implicated in the regulation of human adiposity.},

We report the findings of a genome-wide association study of T1D, combined in a meta-analysis with two previously published studies. The total sample set included 7,514 cases and 9,045 reference samples. Forty-one distinct genomic locations provided evidence for association with T1D in the meta-analysis (P < 10(-6)). After excluding previously reported associations, we further tested 27 regions in an independent set of 4,267 cases, 4,463 controls and 2,319 affected sib-pair (ASP) families. Of these, 18 regions were replicated (P < 0.01; overall P < 5 x 10(-8)) and 4 additional regions provided nominal evidence of replication (P < 0.05). The many new candidate genes suggested by these results include IL10, IL19, IL20, GLIS3, CD69 and IL27.},

	Abstract = {The B vitamins are components of one-carbon metabolism (OCM) that contribute to DNA synthesis and methylation. Homocysteine, a by-product of OCM, has been associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and neurological disease. To investigate genetic factors that affect circulating vitamin B6, vitamin B12, folate and homocysteine, a genome-wide association analysis was conducted in the InCHIANTI (N = 1175), SardiNIA (N = 1115), and BLSA (N = 640) studies. The top loci were replicated in an independent sample of 687 participants in the Progetto Nutrizione study. Polymorphisms in the ALPL gene (rs4654748, p = 8.30 x 10(-18)) were associated with vitamin B6 and FUT2 (rs602662, [corrected] p = 2.83 x 10(-20)) with vitamin B12 serum levels. The association of MTHFR, a gene consistently associated with homocysteine, was confirmed in this meta-analysis. The ALPL gene likely influences the catabolism of vitamin B6 while FUT2 interferes with absorption of vitamin B12. These findings highlight mechanisms that affect vitamin B6, vitamin B12 and homocysteine serum levels.},

	Abstract = {Recent genome-wide (GW) scans have identified several independent loci affecting human stature, but their contribution through the different skeletal components of height is still poorly understood. We carried out a genome-wide scan in 12,611 participants, followed by replication in an additional 7,187 individuals, and identified 17 genomic regions with GW-significant association with height. Of these, two are entirely novel (rs11809207 in CATSPER4, combined P-value = 6.1x10(-8) and rs910316 in TMED10, P-value = 1.4x10(-7)) and two had previously been described with weak statistical support (rs10472828 in NPR3, P-value = 3x10(-7) and rs849141 in JAZF1, P-value = 3.2x10(-11)). One locus (rs1182188 at GNA12) identifies the first height eQTL. We also assessed the contribution of height loci to the upper- (trunk) and lower-body (hip axis and femur) skeletal components of height. We find evidence for several loci associated with trunk length (including rs6570507 in GPR126, P-value = 4x10(-5) and rs6817306 in LCORL, P-value = 4x10(-4)), hip axis length (including rs6830062 at LCORL, P-value = 4.8x10(-4) and rs4911494 at UQCC, P-value = 1.9x10(-4)), and femur length (including rs710841 at PRKG2, P-value = 2.4x10(-5) and rs10946808 at HIST1H1D, P-value = 6.4x10(-6)). Finally, we used conditional analyses to explore a possible differential contribution of the height loci to these different skeletal size measurements. In addition to validating four novel loci controlling adult stature, our study represents the first effort to assess the contribution of genetic loci to three skeletal components of height. Further statistical tests in larger numbers of individuals will be required to verify if the height loci affect height preferentially through these subcomponents of height.},

@article{Kolz09,
	Abstract = {Elevated serum uric acid levels cause gout and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2x10(-201)), ABCG2 (p = 3.1x10(-26)), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0x10(-14)), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7x10(-14)), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0x10(-9)), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1x10(-8)), GCKR (p = 1.4x10(-9)), LRRC16A (p = 8.5x10(-9)), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7x10(-9)). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women. To further characterize the identified variants, we analyzed their association with a panel of metabolites. rs12356193 within SLC16A9 was associated with DL-carnitine (p = 4.0x10(-26)) and propionyl-L-carnitine (p = 5.0x10(-8)) concentrations, which in turn were associated with serum UA levels (p = 1.4x10(-57) and p = 8.1x10(-54), respectively), forming a triangle between SNP, metabolites, and UA levels. Taken together, these associations highlight additional pathways that are important in the regulation of serum uric acid levels and point toward novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent or treat hyperuricemia. In addition, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport proteins are key in regulating serum uric acid levels.},

	Abstract = {We present methods for imputing data for ungenotyped markers and for inferring haplotype phase in large data sets of unrelated individuals and parent-offspring trios. Our methods make use of known haplotype phase when it is available, and our methods are computationally efficient so that the full information in large reference panels with thousands of individuals is utilized. We demonstrate that substantial gains in imputation accuracy accrue with increasingly large reference panel sizes, particularly when imputing low-frequency variants, and that unphased reference panels can provide highly accurate genotype imputation. We place our methodology in a unified framework that enables the simultaneous use of unphased and phased data from trios and unrelated individuals in a single analysis. For unrelated individuals, our imputation methods produce well-calibrated posterior genotype probabilities and highly accurate allele-frequency estimates. For trios, our haplotype-inference method is four orders of magnitude faster than the gold-standard PHASE program and has excellent accuracy. Our methods enable genotype imputation to be performed with unphased trio or unrelated reference panels, thus accounting for haplotype-phase uncertainty in the reference panel. We present a useful measure of imputation accuracy, allelic R(2), and show that this measure can be estimated accurately from posterior genotype probabilities. Our methods are implemented in version 3.0 of the BEAGLE software package.},

	Abstract = {Resequencing is an emerging tool for identification of rare disease-associated mutations. Rare mutations are difficult to tag with SNP genotyping, as genotyping studies are designed to detect common variants. However, studies have shown that genetic heterogeneity is a probable scenario for common diseases, in which multiple rare mutations together explain a large proportion of the genetic basis for the disease. Thus, we propose a weighted-sum method to jointly analyse a group of mutations in order to test for groupwise association with disease status. For example, such a group of mutations may result from resequencing a gene. We compare the proposed weighted-sum method to alternative methods and show that it is powerful for identifying disease-associated genes, both on simulated and Encode data. Using the weighted-sum method, a resequencing study can identify a disease-associated gene with an overall population attributable risk (PAR) of 2\%, even when each individual mutation has much lower PAR, using 1,000 to 7,000 affected and unaffected individuals, depending on the underlying genetic model. This study thus demonstrates that resequencing studies can identify important genetic associations, provided that specialised analysis methods, such as the weighted-sum method, are used.},

	Abstract = {QT interval duration, reflecting myocardial repolarization on the electrocardiogram, is a heritable risk factor for sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias. We conducted a meta-analysis of three genome-wide association studies in 13,685 individuals of European ancestry from the Framingham Heart Study, the Rotterdam Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study, as part of the QTGEN consortium. We observed associations at P < 5 x 10(-8) with variants in NOS1AP, KCNQ1, KCNE1, KCNH2 and SCN5A, known to be involved in myocardial repolarization and mendelian long-QT syndromes. Associations were found at five newly identified loci, including 16q21 near NDRG4 and GINS3, 6q22 near PLN, 1p36 near RNF207, 16p13 near LITAF and 17q12 near LIG3 and RFFL. Collectively, the 14 independent variants at these 10 loci explain 5.4-6.5\% of the variation in QT interval. These results, together with an accompanying paper, offer insights into myocardial repolarization and suggest candidate genes that could predispose to sudden cardiac death and drug-induced arrhythmias.},

	Abstract = {Identifying the ancestry of chromosomal segments of distinct ancestry has a wide range of applications from disease mapping to learning about history. Most methods require the use of unlinked markers; but, using all markers from genome-wide scanning arrays, it should in principle be possible to infer the ancestry of even very small segments with exquisite accuracy. We describe a method, HAPMIX, which employs an explicit population genetic model to perform such local ancestry inference based on fine-scale variation data. We show that HAPMIX outperforms other methods, and we explore its utility for inferring ancestry, learning about ancestral populations, and inferring dates of admixture. We validate the method empirically by applying it to populations that have experienced recent and ancient admixture: 935 African Americans from the United States and 29 Mozabites from North Africa. HAPMIX will be of particular utility for mapping disease genes in recently admixed populations, as its accurate estimates of local ancestry permit admixture and case-control association signals to be combined, enabling more powerful tests of association than with either signal alone.},

@article{Han09a,
	Abstract = {With the development of high-throughput sequencing and genotyping technologies, the number of markers collected in genetic association studies is growing rapidly, increasing the importance of methods for correcting for multiple hypothesis testing. The permutation test is widely considered the gold standard for accurate multiple testing correction, but it is often computationally impractical for these large datasets. Recently, several studies proposed efficient alternative approaches to the permutation test based on the multivariate normal distribution (MVN). However, they cannot accurately correct for multiple testing in genome-wide association studies for two reasons. First, these methods require partitioning of the genome into many disjoint blocks and ignore all correlations between markers from different blocks. Second, the true null distribution of the test statistic often fails to follow the asymptotic distribution at the tails of the distribution. We propose an accurate and efficient method for multiple testing correction in genome-wide association studies--SLIDE. Our method accounts for all correlation within a sliding window and corrects for the departure of the true null distribution of the statistic from the asymptotic distribution. In simulations using the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium data, the error rate of SLIDE's corrected p-values is more than 20 times smaller than the error rate of the previous MVN-based methods' corrected p-values, while SLIDE is orders of magnitude faster than the permutation test and other competing methods. We also extend the MVN framework to the problem of estimating the statistical power of an association study with correlated markers and propose an efficient and accurate power estimation method SLIP. SLIP and SLIDE are available at http://slide.cs.ucla.edu.},

Variance component approaches, such as efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), can correct for a wide range of sample structures by explicitly accounting for pairwise relatedness between individuals, using high-density markers to model the phenotype distribution; but such approaches are computationally impractical. We report here a variance component approach implemented in publicly available software, EMMA eXpedited (EMMAX), that reduces the computational time for analyzing large GWAS data sets from years to hours. We apply this method to two human GWAS data sets, performing association analysis for ten quantitative traits from the Northern Finland Birth Cohort and seven common diseases from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium. We find that EMMAX outperforms both principal component analysis and genomic control in correcting for sample structure.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have rapidly become a standard method for disease gene discovery. A substantial number of recent GWAS indicate that for most disorders, only a few common variants are implicated and the associated SNPs explain only a small fraction of the genetic risk. This review is written from the viewpoint that findings from the GWAS provide preliminary genetic information that is available for additional analysis by statistical procedures that accumulate evidence, and that these secondary analyses are very likely to provide valuable information that will help prioritize the strongest constellations of results. We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact. Pathway analysis of GWAS results is used to prioritize genes and pathways within a biological context. Following a GWAS, association results can be assigned to pathways and tested in aggregate with computational tools and pathway databases. Reviews of published methods with recommendations for their application are provided within the framework for each approach.},

Of 34 SNPs selected for replication, 7 new rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles were identified at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10(-8)) in an analysis of all 41,282 samples. The associated SNPs are near genes of known immune function, including IL6ST, SPRED2, RBPJ, CCR6, IRF5 and PXK. We also refined associations at two established rheumatoid arthritis risk loci (IL2RA and CCL21) and confirmed the association at AFF3. These new associations bring the total number of confirmed rheumatoid arthritis risk loci to 31 among individuals of European ancestry. An additional 11 SNPs replicated at P < 0.05, many of which are validated autoimmune risk alleles, suggesting that most represent genuine rheumatoid arthritis risk alleles.},

We performed a meta-analysis of five case-control cohorts for major mood disorder, including over 13,600 individuals genotyped on high-density SNP arrays. We identified SNPs at 3p21.1 associated with major mood disorders (rs2251219, P = 3.63 x 10(-8); odds ratio = 0.87; 95\% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92), with supportive evidence for association observed in two out of three independent replication cohorts.

@article{Zaitlen10,
	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have been performed extensively in the last few years, resulting in many new discoveries of genomic regions that are associated with complex traits. It is often the case that a SNP found to be associated with the condition is not the causal SNP, but a proxy to it as a result of linkage disequilibrium. For the identification of the actual causal SNP, fine-mapping follow-up is performed, either with the use of dense genotyping or by sequencing of the region. In either case, if the causal SNP is in high linkage disequilibrium with other SNPs, the fine-mapping procedure will require a very large sample size for the identification of the causal SNP. Here, we show that by leveraging genetic variability across populations, we significantly increase the localization success rate (LSR) for a causal SNP in a follow-up study that involves multiple populations as compared to a study that involves only one population. Thus, the average power for detection of the causal variant will be higher in a joint analysis than that in studies in which only one population is analyzed at a time. On the basis of this observation, we developed a framework to efficiently search for a follow-up study design: our framework searches for the best combination of populations from a pool of available populations to maximize the LSR for detection of a causal variant. This framework and its accompanying software can be used to considerably enhance the power of fine-mapping studies.},

	Abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can identify common alleles that contribute to complex disease susceptibility. Despite the large number of SNPs assessed in each study, the effects of most common SNPs must be evaluated indirectly using either genotyped markers or haplotypes thereof as proxies. We have previously implemented a computationally efficient Markov Chain framework for genotype imputation and haplotyping in the freely available MaCH software package. The approach describes sampled chromosomes as mosaics of each other and uses available genotype and shotgun sequence data to estimate unobserved genotypes and haplotypes, together with useful measures of the quality of these estimates. Our approach is already widely used to facilitate comparison of results across studies as well as meta-analyses of GWAS. Here, we use simulations and experimental genotypes to evaluate its accuracy and utility, considering choices of genotyping panels, reference panel configurations, and designs where genotyping is replaced with shotgun sequencing. Importantly, we show that genotype imputation not only facilitates cross study analyses but also increases power of genetic association studies. We show that genotype imputation of common variants using HapMap haplotypes as a reference is very accurate using either genome-wide SNP data or smaller amounts of data typical in fine-mapping studies. Furthermore, we show the approach is applicable in a variety of populations. Finally, we illustrate how association analyses of unobserved variants will benefit from ongoing advances such as larger HapMap reference panels and whole genome shotgun sequencing technologies.

	Abstract = {MOTIVATION: In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examining hundreds of thousands of genetic markers, the potentially high number of false positive findings requires statistical correction for multiple testing. Permutation tests are considered the gold standard for multiple testing correction in GWAS, because they simultaneously provide unbiased type I error control and high power. At the same time, they demand heavy computational effort, especially with large-scale datasets of modern GWAS. In recent years, the computational problem has been circumvented by using approximations to permutation tests, which, however, may be biased. RESULTS: We have tackled the original computational problem of permutation testing in GWAS and herein present a permutation test algorithm one or more orders of magnitude faster than existing implementations, which enables efficient permutation testing on a genome-wide scale. Our algorithm does not rely on any kind of approximation and hence produces unbiased results identical to a standard permutation test. A noteworthy feature of our algorithm is a particularly effective performance when analyzing high-density marker sets. AVAILABILITY: Freely available on the web at http://www.permory.org.},

	Abstract = {The genetics of phenotypic variation in inbred mice has for nearly a century provided a primary weapon in the medical research arsenal. A catalog of the genetic variation among inbred mouse strains, however, is required to enable powerful positional cloning and association techniques. A recent whole-genome resequencing study of 15 inbred mouse strains captured a significant fraction of the genetic variation among a limited number of strains, yet the common use of hundreds of inbred strains in medical research motivates the need for a high-density variation map of a larger set of strains. Here we report a dense set of genotypes from 94 inbred mouse strains containing 10.77 million genotypes over 121,433 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), dispersed at 20-kb intervals on average across the genome, with an average concordance of 99.94\% with previous SNP sets. Through pairwise comparisons of the strains, we identified an average of 4.70 distinct segments over 73 classical inbred strains in each region of the genome, suggesting limited genetic diversity between the strains. Combining these data with genotypes of 7570 gap-filling SNPs, we further imputed the untyped or missing genotypes of 94 strains over 8.27 million Perlegen SNPs. The imputation accuracy among classical inbred strains is estimated at 99.7\% for the genotypes imputed with high confidence. We demonstrated the utility of these data in high-resolution linkage mapping through power simulations and statistical power analysis and provide guidelines for developing such studies. We also provide a resource of in silico association mapping between the complex traits deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database with our genotypes. We expect that these resources will facilitate effective designs of both human and mouse studies for dissecting the genetic basis of complex traits.},

@article{Devlin01,
	Abstract = {Large, population-based samples and large-scale genotyping are being used to evaluate disease/gene associations. A substantial drawback to such samples is the fact that population substructure can induce spurious associations between genes and disease. We review two methods, called genomic control (GC) and structured association (SA), that obviate many of the concerns about population substructure by using the features of the genomes present in the sample to correct for stratification. The GC approach exploits the fact that population substructure generates "over dispersion" of statistics used to assess association. By testing multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, only some of which are pertinent to the disease of interest, the degree of overdispersion generated by population substructure can be estimated and taken into account. The SA approach assumes that the sampled population, although heterogeneous, is composed of subpopulations that are themselves homogeneous. By using multiple polymorphisms throughout the genome, this "latent class method" estimates the probability sampled individuals derive from each of these latent subpopulations. GC has the advantage of robustness, simplicity, and wide applicability, even to experimental designs such as DNA pooling. SA is a bit more complicated but has the advantage of greater power in some realistic settings, such as admixed populations or when association varies widely across subpopulations. It, too, is widely applicable. Both also have weaknesses, as elaborated in our review.},

One, the fixed effects model, takes the studies being analysed as the universe of interest; the other, the random effects model, takes these studies as representing a sample from a larger population of possible studies. With emphasis on clinical trials, this paper illustrates in some detail the application of both models to three summary measures of the effect of an experimental intervention versus a control: the standardized difference for comparing two means, and the relative risk and odds ratio for comparing two proportions.},

@article{voight2005confounding,
	Abstract = {Case-control association studies are widely used in the search for genetic variants that contribute to human diseases. It has long been known that such studies may suffer from high rates of false positives if there is unrecognized population structure. It is perhaps less widely appreciated that so-called "cryptic relatedness" (i.e., kinship among the cases or controls that is not known to the investigator) might also potentially inflate the false positive rate. Until now there has been little work to assess how serious this problem is likely to be in practice. In this paper, we develop a formal model of cryptic relatedness, and study its impact on association studies. We provide simple expressions that predict the extent of confounding due to cryptic relatedness. Surprisingly, these expressions are functions of directly observable parameters. Our analytical results show that, for well-designed studies in outbred populations, the degree of confounding due to cryptic relatedness will usually be negligible. However, in contrast, studies where there is a sampling bias toward collecting relatives may indeed suffer from excessive rates of false positives. Furthermore, cryptic relatedness may be a serious concern in founder populations that have grown rapidly and recently from a small size. As an example, we analyze the impact of excess relatedness among cases for six phenotypes measured in the Hutterite population.},

	Abstract = {As population structure can result in spurious associations, it has constrained the use of association studies in human and plant genetics. Association mapping, however, holds great promise if true signals of functional association can be separated from the vast number of false signals generated by population structure. We have developed a unified mixed-model approach to account for multiple levels of relatedness simultaneously as detected by random genetic markers. We applied this new approach to two samples: a family-based sample of 14 human families, for quantitative gene expression dissection, and a sample of 277 diverse maize inbred lines with complex familial relationships and population structure, for quantitative trait dissection. Our method demonstrates improved control of both type I and type II error rates over other methods. As this new method crosses the boundary between family-based and structured association samples, it provides a powerful complement to currently available methods for association mapping.},

	Abstract = {Systems genetics relies on common genetic variants to elucidate biologic networks contributing to complex disease-related phenotypes. Mice are ideal model organisms for such approaches, but linkage analysis has been only modestly successful due to low mapping resolution. Association analysis in mice has the potential of much better resolution, but it is confounded by population structure and inadequate power to map traits that explain less than 10\% of the variance, typical of mouse quantitative trait loci (QTL). We report a novel strategy for association mapping that combines classic inbred strains for mapping resolution and recombinant inbred strains for mapping power. Using a mixed model algorithm to correct for population structure, we validate the approach by mapping over 2500 cis-expression QTL with a resolution an order of magnitude narrower than traditional QTL analysis. We also report the fine mapping of metabolic traits such as plasma lipids. This resource, termed the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel, makes possible the integration of multiple data sets and should prove useful for systems-based approaches to complex traits and studies of gene-by-environment interactions.},

	Abstract = {Rapid expansion of available data, both phenotypic and genotypic, for multiple strains of mice has enabled the development of new methods to interrogate the mouse genome for functional genetic perturbations. In silico mapping provides an expedient way to associate the natural diversity of phenotypic traits with ancestrally inherited polymorphisms for the purpose of dissecting genetic traits. In mouse, the current single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data have lacked the density across the genome and coverage of enough strains to properly achieve this goal. To remedy this, 470,407 allele calls were produced for 10,990 evenly spaced SNP loci across 48 inbred mouse strains. Use of the SNP set with statistical models that considered unique patterns within blocks of three SNPs as an inferred haplotype could successfully map known single gene traits and a cloned quantitative trait gene. Application of this method to high-density lipoprotein and gallstone phenotypes reproduced previously characterized quantitative trait loci (QTL). The inferred haplotype data also facilitates the refinement of QTL regions such that candidate genes can be more easily identified and characterized as shown for adenylate cyclase 7.},

	Abstract = {High density lipoproteins (HDL) are heterogeneous particles consisting of about equal amounts of lipid and protein that are thought to mediate the transport of cholesterol from peripheral tissues to liver. We show that a previously identified polymorphism affecting HDL electrophoretic mobility in mice is due to a monogenic variation controlling HDL size and apolipoprotein composition. Thus, the HDL particles of various inbred strains of mice exhibit a striking difference in the ratio fo the two major apolipoproteins of HDL, apoA-I and apoA-II. HDL particles in all strains examined contain an average of about five apoA-I molecules; however, whereas the strains with small HDL contain two to three apoA-II molecules per particle, the strains with large HDL contain about five apoA-II molecules per particle. This increase in the protein content of the large HDL is also accompanied by increased lipid content. The HDL size polymorphism and apoA-II levels cosegregate with the apoA-II structural gene on mouse chromosome 1, indicating that a mutation of the apoA-II gene locus is responsible. The rates of synthesis of apoA-II are increased in the strains with large HDL and high apoA-II levels as compared to the strains with small HDL and low apoA-II levels. On the other hand, the fractional catabolic rates of both apoA-I and apoA-II among the strains are very similar, confirming that apoA-II concentrations are controlled at the level of synthesis. Despite the difference in rates of apoA-II synthesis between strains, the apoA-II mRNA levels in the strains are not discernibly different, suggesting that a mutation of the apoA-II structural gene controls apoA-II translational efficiency. This was confirmed by translating apoA-II mRNA in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system. Sequencing of apoA-II cDNA from the strains revealed a number of nucleotide substitutions, which may affect translational efficiency. We conclude that the assembly of apoA-II into HDL does not have a set stoichiometry but, rather, is controlled by the production of apoA-II. As apoA-II levels increase, the HDL particles become larger and acquire more lipid, but apoA-I content per particle remains unchanged. These studies with mice provide a model for the metabolic relationships between apoA-I, apoA-II, and HDL lipid in humans.},

So far, the potential of mapping both quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in rodents has been limited by the low mapping resolution inherent in crosses between inbred strains. We provide a megabase resolution map of thousands of eQTLs in hippocampus, lung, and liver samples from heterogeneous stock (HS) mice in which 843 QTLs have also been mapped at megabase resolution. We exploit dense mouse SNP data to show that artifacts due to allele-specific hybridization occur in approximately 30\% of the cis-acting eQTLs and, by comparison with exon expression data, we show that alternative splicing of the 3' end of the genes accounts for <1\% of cis-acting eQTLs. Approximately one third of cis-acting eQTLs and one half of trans-acting eQTLs are tissue specific. We have created an important systems biology resource for the genetic analysis of complex traits in a key model organism.},

	Abstract = {Concentrations of plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) are inversely correlated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. The two most abundant protein constituents of HDL are apolipoproteins A-I and A-II (apoA-I and apoA-II). ApoA-I is required for assembly of HDL and, when overexpressed in transgenic mice, confers resistance to early atherosclerosis. The present studies reveal that transgenic mice that overexpress mouse apoA-II had elevated HDL-cholesterol concentrations but, nevertheless, exhibited increased atherosclerotic lesion development as compared to normal mice. The HDL in the transgenic mice was larger and had an increased ratio of apoA-II to apoA-I. Thus, both the composition and amount of HDL appear to be important determinants of atherosclerosis.},

	Abstract = {Significant advances have been made in the discovery of genes affecting bone mineral density (BMD); however, our understanding of its genetic basis remains incomplete. In the current study, genome-wide association (GWA) and co-expression network analysis were used in the recently described Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel (HMDP) to identify and functionally characterize novel BMD genes. In the HMDP, a GWA of total body, spinal, and femoral BMD revealed four significant associations (-log10P>5.39) affecting at least one BMD trait on chromosomes (Chrs.) 7, 11, 12, and 17. The associations implicated a total of 163 genes with each association harboring between 14 and 112 genes. This list was reduced to 26 functional candidates by identifying those genes that were regulated by local eQTL in bone or harbored potentially functional non-synonymous (NS) SNPs. This analysis revealed that the most significant BMD SNP on Chr. 12 was a NS SNP in the additional sex combs like-2 (Asxl2) gene that was predicted to be functional. The involvement of Asxl2 in the regulation of bone mass was confirmed by the observation that Asxl2 knockout mice had reduced BMD. To begin to unravel the mechanism through which Asxl2 influenced BMD, a gene co-expression network was created using cortical bone gene expression microarray data from the HMDP strains. Asxl2 was identified as a member of a co-expression module enriched for genes involved in the differentiation of myeloid cells. In bone, osteoclasts are bone-resorbing cells of myeloid origin, suggesting that Asxl2 may play a role in osteoclast differentiation. In agreement, the knockdown of Asxl2 in bone marrow macrophages impaired their ability to form osteoclasts. This study identifies a new regulator of BMD and osteoclastogenesis and highlights the power of GWA and systems genetics in the mouse for dissecting complex genetic traits.},

	Abstract = {Numerous quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting bone traits have been identified in the mouse; however, few of the underlying genes have been discovered. To improve the process of transitioning from QTL to gene, we describe an integrative genetics approach, which combines linkage analysis, expression QTL (eQTL) mapping, causality modeling, and genetic association in outbred mice. In C57BL/6J x C3H/HeJ (BXH) F(2) mice, nine QTLs regulating femoral BMD were identified. To select candidate genes from within each QTL region, microarray gene expression profiles from individual F(2) mice were used to identify 148 genes whose expression was correlated with BMD and regulated by local eQTLs. Many of the genes that were the most highly correlated with BMD have been previously shown to modulate bone mass or skeletal development. Candidates were further prioritized by determining whether their expression was predicted to underlie variation in BMD. Using network edge orienting (NEO), a causality modeling algorithm, 18 of the 148 candidates were predicted to be causally related to differences in BMD. To fine-map QTLs, markers in outbred MF1 mice were tested for association with BMD. Three chromosome 11 SNPs were identified that were associated with BMD within the Bmd11 QTL. Finally, our approach provides strong support for Wnt9a, Rasd1, or both underlying Bmd11. Integration of multiple genetic and genomic data sets can substantially improve the efficiency of QTL fine-mapping and candidate gene identification.},

We now report analyses of the molecular basis of these sex differences and of the effects of sex on gene expression networks. We analyzed liver gene expression of hormone-treated gonadectomized mice as well as XX male and XY female mice. Differences in gene expression resulted in large part from acute effects of gonadal hormones acting in adulthood, and the effects of sex chromosomes, apart from hormones, were modest. We also determined whether there are sex differences in the organization of gene expression networks in adipose, liver, skeletal muscle, and brain tissue. Although coexpression networks of highly correlated genes were largely conserved between sexes, some exhibited striking sex dependence. We observed strong body fat and lipid correlations with sex-specific modules in adipose and liver as well as a sexually dimorphic network enriched for genes affected by gonadal hormones. Finally, our analyses identified chromosomal loci regulating sexually dimorphic networks. This study indicates that gonadal hormones play a strong role in sex differences in gene expression. In addition, it results in the identification of sex-specific gene coexpression networks related to genetic and metabolic traits.},

	Abstract = {Rodent inbred line crosses are widely used to map genetic loci associated with complex traits. This approach has proven to be powerful for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL); however, the resolution of QTL locations, typically 20 cM, means that hundreds of genes are implicated as potential candidates. We describe analytical methods based on linear models to combine information available in two or more inbred line crosses. Our strategy is motivated by the hypothesis that common inbred strains of the laboratory mouse are derived from a limited ancestral gene pool and thus QTL detected in multiple crosses are likely to represent shared ancestral polymorphisms. We demonstrate that the combined-cross analysis can improve the power to detect weak QTL, can narrow support intervals for QTL regions, and can be used to separate multiple QTL that colocalize by chance. Moreover, combined-cross analysis can establish the allelic states of a QTL among a set of parental lines, thus providing critical information for narrowing QTL regions by haplotype analysis.},

	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Our understanding of the genetic basis of learning and memory remains shrouded in mystery. To explore the genetic networks governing the biology of conditional fear, we used a systems genetics approach to analyze a hybrid mouse diversity panel (HMDP) with high mapping resolution.

RESULTS: A total of 27 behavioral quantitative trait loci were mapped with a false discovery rate of 5\%. By integrating fear phenotypes, transcript profiling data from hippocampus and striatum and also genotype information, two gene co-expression networks correlated with context-dependent immobility were identified. We prioritized the key markers and genes in these pathways using intramodular connectivity measures and structural equation modeling. Highly connected genes in the context fear modules included Psmd6, Ube2a and Usp33, suggesting an important role for ubiquitination in learning and memory. In addition, we surveyed the architecture of brain transcript regulation and demonstrated preservation of gene co-expression modules in hippocampus and striatum, while also highlighting important differences. Rps15a, Kif3a, Stard7, 6330503K22RIK, and Plvap were among the individual genes whose transcript abundance were strongly associated with fear phenotypes.

CONCLUSION: Application of our multi-faceted mapping strategy permits an increasingly detailed characterization of the genetic networks underlying behavior.},

	Abstract = {Recent developments in high-density genotyping and statistical analysis methods that have enabled genome-wide association studies in humans can also be applied to outbred mouse populations. Increased recombination in outbred populations is expected to provide greater mapping resolution than traditional inbred line crosses, improving prospects for identifying the causal genes. We carried out genome-wide association mapping by using 288 mice from a commercially available outbred stock; NMRI mice were genotyped with a high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism array to map loci influencing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, triglyceride levels, glucose, and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratios. We found significant associations (P < 10(-5)) with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and identified Apoa2 and Scarb1, both of which have been previously reported, as candidate genes for these associations. Additional suggestive associations (P < 10(-3)) identified in this study were also concordant with published quantitative trait loci, suggesting that we are sampling from a limited pool of genetic diversity that has already been well characterized. These findings dampen our enthusiasm for currently available commercial outbred stocks as genetic mapping resources and highlight the need for new outbred populations with greater genetic diversity. Despite the lack of novel associations in the NMRI population, our analysis strategy illustrates the utility of methods that could be applied to genome-wide association studies in humans.},

@article{Kang:2008bx,
	Abstract = {Genomewide association mapping in model organisms such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach for the identification of risk factors related to human diseases. However, genetic association studies in inbred model organisms are confronted by the problem of complex population structure among strains. This induces inflated false positive rates, which cannot be corrected using standard approaches applied in human association studies such as genomic control or structured association. Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping. Our method takes advantage of the specific nature of the optimization problem in applying mixed models for association mapping, which allows us to substantially increase the computational speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA to in silico whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies while avoiding an inflation of false positives. An R package implementation and webserver of our EMMA method are publicly available.},
